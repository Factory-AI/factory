description: "Detailed guide for connecting Factory with your self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server"
---

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for integrating Factory with your GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) instance. This integration enables the Factory platform to securely access and work with your on-premise repositories.

> Connecting to a GitHub Enterprise Server is only supported in the Enterprise plan.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your GitHub Enterprise Server instance
- Network access between your GHES instance and Factory's AWS VPC
- A Factory account with an Enterprise plan and admin privileges 

## Integration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup & Information Gathering">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create GitHub App">
        1. Navigate to your GHES instance settings.
        2. Go to GitHub Apps and click "New GitHub App".
        3. Fill in the app details:
           - Name: "Factory Integration"
           - Homepage URL: https://factory.ai
           - Webhook URL: (Provided by Factory)
        4. Set permissions as outlined in the "Required Permissions" section below.
        5. Generate and securely store a private key for the app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Collect Integration Information">
        Gather the following details:

        - GitHub App ID
        - Client ID
        - Client Secret
        - Webhook Secret
        - Private Key (generated in previous step)
        - Your GHES instance hostname
      </Step>
      <Step title="Submit Information to Factory">
        Securely send the collected information to your Factory representative.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Security Configuration">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Evaluate Network Policy">
        Review your current network security policies to identify potential connectivity barriers with Factory's AWS VPC.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Establish Connectivity">
        Choose one of the following methods:

        1. VPC Peering (if your GHES is on AWS):
           - Initiate a VPC peering request.
           - Exchange VPC IDs with Factory.
           - Configure route tables for direct network routes.
        2. VPN Connection:
           - Establish a VPN between your network and Factory's.
           - Ensure VPN settings (e.g., IPsec) are compatible on both ends.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Firewall Configuration">
        - Allow outbound connections to Factory's services (HTTPS and SSH traffic).
        - Ensure your GHES instance can communicate with the Factory-provided Lambda function URL.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Webhook Setup">
    Configure the webhook in your GHES to send events to the Factory-provided cloud function URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Required Permissions">
    Ensure the GitHub App has the following permissions:

    - Actions and Metadata (Read)
    - Code (Read & Write)
    - Commit Statuses (Read & Write)
    - Discussions (Read & Write)
    - Issues (Read & Write)
    - Pull Requests (Read & Write)
    - Workflows (Read & Write)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing and Validation">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Preliminary Testing">
        Work with Factory to conduct initial tests of webhook connectivity and data exchange.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Comprehensive Testing">
        Test all GitHub events that trigger Tools within Factory, including:

        - Creating pull requests
        - Pushing code
        - Opening issues
      </Step>
      <Step title="Validation">
        Verify that Factory Tools respond correctly to these events.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Adjustments and Go-Live">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Feedback and Adjustments">
        Provide feedback on any issues encountered during testing. Work with Factory to make necessary adjustments.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Go-Live">
        Agree on a go-live date with Factory.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Monitoring">
        Implement continuous monitoring for the initial days post-launch to quickly address any unforeseen issues.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- If webhook events aren't being received, check your network configuration and firewall rules.
- For permission-related issues, review the GitHub App settings in your GHES instance.
- If Factory isn't responding as expected, verify that all required events are being sent and that permissions are correctly set.
