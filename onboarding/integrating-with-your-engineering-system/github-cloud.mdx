This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with GitHub Cloud, enabling the Factory platform to access and work with your repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A Factory account with admin privileges
- Admin access to your GitHub organization

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Factory Platform">
    Log in to your Factory account and navigate to the Integrations section in your Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate GitHub Integration">
    Click on "Connect" next to Github to start the integration process. Select Manage Github Permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Factory's GitHub App">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub. Click "Authorize" to allow Factory's secure OAuth2 GitHub Application access to your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Repository Access">
    Select the repositories you want Factory to access. You can choose specific repositories or grant access to all current and future repositories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Permissions">
    Factory requires specific permissions to function optimally. Review and approve the following permissions:

    - **Actions and Metadata** (Read Access): Allows Factory to access GitHub Actions data for understanding CI processes and diagnosing test failures.
    - **Code** (Read and Write Access): Necessary for Factory to review code and create pull requests. Note that Factory cannot merge code autonomously.
    - **Commit Statuses** (Read and Write Access): Enables Factory to track and update commit statuses.
    - **Discussions** (Read and Write Access): Allows Factory to analyze and participate in repository discussions.
    - **Issues** (Read and Write Access): Enables Factory to interact with issues for automated ticket handling.
    - **Pull Requests** (Read and Write Access): Necessary for Factory to analyze and facilitate code reviews.
    - **Workflows** (Read and Write Access): Allows Factory to manage and potentially correct failed CI runs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to Factory. Confirm that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test repository or use an existing one with minimal sensitive data.
2. Initiate a simple workflow, such as creating a pull request.
3. Verify that Factory can access and interact with the repository as expected.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
- Use repository-specific settings to fine-tune access levels for sensitive projects.
- Keep your GitHub organization's security settings up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have the necessary admin rights on both Factory and GitHub.
- Check GitHub's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
- Verify that your organization doesn't have conflicting third-party application restrictions.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
