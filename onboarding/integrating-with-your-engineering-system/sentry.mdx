---

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with Sentry, enabling the Factory platform to access and work with your error tracking data.

## Prerequisites

- A Factory account with admin privileges
- Admin access to your Sentry organization
- Sentry projects set up for your applications

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Factory Platform">
    Log in to your Factory account and navigate to the Integrations section in your Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Sentry Integration">
    Click on "Connect" next to Sentry to start the integration process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Factory's Sentry Integration">
    You'll be redirected to Sentry. Review and approve the installation of Factory's Sentry integration in your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access Permissions">
    Factory requires specific permissions to function optimally:

    - **Issue & Event Access** (Read Access): Allows Factory to retrieve issue details, stack traces, and related events
    - **Organization Access** (Read Access): Enables Factory to access organization-wide settings and metadata
    - **Project Access** (Read Access): Permits Factory to access project-specific information and settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to Factory. Verify that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Once integrated, Factory can:

1. **Access Issue Details**: View comprehensive information about errors, including stack traces, breadcrumbs, and context data
2. **Search Issues**: Find specific issues across your Sentry projects
3. **Analyze Error Patterns**: Understand error trends and common failure points
4. **Context Integration**: Use Sentry data as context when discussing code changes or debugging

### Issue Context

When you share a Sentry issue URL in a Factory chat, the assistant will automatically:

1. Retrieve the issue details
2. Extract relevant stack traces
3. Include error context and breadcrumbs
4. Provide insights based on the error information

Example Sentry issue URL format:

```
https://sentry.io/organizations/your-org/issues/12345/
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory
- Use Sentry's project-level settings to fine-tune access control
- Keep your Sentry organization's security settings up-to-date
- Periodically review the integration's usage and effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have the necessary admin rights in both Factory and Sentry
- Check Sentry's audit logs for any permission-related issues
- Verify that your organization doesn't have conflicting third-party application restrictions

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
