This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with GitLab Cloud, enabling the Factory platform to seamlessly work with your GitLab repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A Factory account with admin privileges
- Admin access to your GitLab Cloud organization

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Factory Platform">
    Log in to your Factory account and navigate to the Integrations section in your Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate GitLab Integration">
    Click on "Connect" next to Gitlab to start the integration process. Select Manage Gitlab Permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Factory's GitLab Application">
    You'll be redirected to GitLab. Review the requested permissions and click "Authorize" to allow Factory's secure OAuth2 GitLab Application access to your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Approve Permissions">
    Factory requires two main OAuth scopes to function optimally:

    - **api**: This comprehensive scope allows Factory to read from and write to your repositories, manage issues and merge requests, and comment on commits.
    - **read_user**: This scope enables Factory to access user information, providing better context for various operations.

    Ensure these scopes are selected before proceeding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Repository Access">
    Select the repositories you want Factory to access. You can choose specific repositories or grant access to all current and future repositories within the authorized groups or personal namespace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to Factory. Confirm that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test repository or use an existing one with minimal sensitive data.
2. Initiate a simple workflow, such as creating a merge request.
3. Verify that Factory can access and interact with the repository as expected.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
- Use GitLab's group-level settings to manage access for multiple projects efficiently.
- Keep your GitLab organization's security settings up-to-date.
- Periodically review the list of authorized applications in your GitLab settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have the necessary admin rights on both Factory and GitLab.
- Check GitLab's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
- Verify that the OAuth application is properly authorized in your GitLab settings.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
