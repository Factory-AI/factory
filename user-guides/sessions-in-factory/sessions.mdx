## Best Practices for Panel Management

1. **Optimize for Your Workflow**: Arrange panels based on your current task. For coding, you might want the fragment panel prominent, while for exploration, the Chat panel might take center stage.

2. **Leverage the Chat History**: Use the Chat History panel to navigate through your work process and revisit earlier parts of your conversation.

3. **Keep Context Visible**: The Context panel can be crucial for understanding your current working environment. Consider keeping it visible, even if small.

4. **Utilize Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn and use keyboard shortcuts for quick panel navigation and management. (Tip: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open the command palette for quick actions)

## Conclusion

Mastering the session interface in Factory allows you to create a tailored environment that enhances your productivity. Experiment with different panel layouts and combinations to find what works best for your unique workflow.
