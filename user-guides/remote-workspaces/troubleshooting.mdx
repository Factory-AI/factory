Even the smoothest remote workspace can hit a snag. This guide walks you through the quickest fixes for the most common remote workspace issues.

## Quick Reference

| Category               | Typical Symptoms                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace Creation** | “Provisioning” forever, cloning errors, devcontainer upload fails             |
| **Connection**         | Can’t attach from session, pairing spinner never stops, “Machine unavailable” |
| **Performance**        | Slow rebuilds, high latency in terminal, laggy editor                         |
| **Devcontainer**       | Build errors, “command not found”, ports not reachable                        |

## 1. Workspace Creation Issues

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Repository clone failed">
    **Diagnose**  
    - Error toast shows *“clone failed”* with a Git exit code  
    - Private repo? Missing OAuth scopes?

    **Resolve**
    1. Verify the repo is enabled and displays **Connected** in Integrations
    2. Refresh your OAuth token if prompted

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Devcontainer upload error">
    **Diagnose**  
    - Upload modal closes with *“Failed to save devcontainer”*  
    - File larger than 1 MB or not JSON?

    **Resolve**
    1. Confirm file is named **devcontainer.json** and under 1 MB
    2. Validate JSON with an online linter
    3. Re-upload and click **Create Workspace**

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Connection Problems

<Steps>

  <Step title="Check Machine Selector">
    In your session, click the **CPU** icon → ensure **Cloud Machine** is selected.  
    If it shows **Local Machine**, switch to **Cloud Machine** and pick the workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browser & Network">
    - Use **Chrome** or **Edge** (other browsers may block WebSocket upgrades).  
    - Disable VPN/proxy to rule out WebSocket filtering.  
    - Reload the session tab (⌘R / Ctrl-R).
  </Step>

</Steps>

## 3. Performance & Speed

| Symptom                   | Fix                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rebuild takes > 5 min** | Add `.dockerignore` for `node_modules`, `*.pyc`, build outputs• Use a lighter base image (e.g., alpine)                        |
| **Terminal latency**      | Close unused browser tabs with heavy JS• Check local bandwidth (>5 Mbps recommended)• Pause real-time spell-checker extensions |
| **Editor lag**            | Disable file watchers in dev tools (`nodemon`, `webpack --watch`) unless needed• Use auto-save only when collaborating         |

## 4. Devcontainer Configuration Errors

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Build fails with 'command not found'">
    **Diagnose** – The failing command runs inside `postCreateCommand`.

    **Resolve**
    1. Ensure the binary is installed earlier in the image or via your package manager (`apt-get`, `npm`, `pip`).
    2. Rebuild locally:
       <pre>devcontainer up --workspace-folder .</pre>
       Fix until it succeeds, then push changes and rebuild the workspace.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment variable undefined">
    **Diagnose** – Script prints blank when echoing `$MY_SECRET`.

    **Resolve**
    1. Check **Integrations → Secrets** for correct name and value.
    2. Redeploy the workspace (hibernating won’t reload new secrets).
    3. Avoid exporting secrets during image build; read them at runtime.

  </Accordion>

## 5. General Usage Troubles

| Issue                              | Resolution                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Git prompts for credentials**    | Make sure the repo integration is connected; remote workspace injects HTTPS tokens automatically.                        |
| **Disk quota exceeded**            | Clear package caches (`npm cache clean --force`, `pip cache purge`), remove large build artifacts, or rebuild workspace. |
| **Permission denied on file save** | File is outside the repo workspace; save inside `/workspaces/&lt;repo&gt;/`.                                             |
| **Cannot install global packages** | Use `npm install -g` or `pip install --user`. If still blocked, add commands to `postCreateCommand`.                     |
| **History lost after rebuild**     | Anything outside `/workspaces` is cleared during rebuild. Commit important scripts or store them inside the repo.        |
