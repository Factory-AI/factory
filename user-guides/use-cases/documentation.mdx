Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is crucial for the success of any software project. Factory can significantly help with the process of creating and maintaining documentation for your codebases. This guide will walk you through how to use Factory to generate various types of documentation, from API references to user guides.

## Getting Started

Before diving into documentation writing with Factory, ensure you have:

1. Access to Factory

2. Your codebase ready for analysis

3. An understanding of the types of documentation you need

## Documentation Workflow with Factory

### 1. Analyze Your Codebase

Start by asking Factory to analyze your codebase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import Code">
    Use Factory's [codebase search](/user-guides/managing-context/codebase-search) or file upload feature to import your code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request Analysis">
    Ask Factory to analyze the imported code:

    "I've imported our project's 'src' directory. Can you analyze the code structure and provide an overview of the main modules and their purposes?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Documentation Needs">
    Based on the analysis, determine documentation priorities:

    "Based on your analysis, what types of documentation do you think are most crucial for this project?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Generate API Documentation

Use Factory to create detailed API documentation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Function Documentation">
    Request documentation for specific functions:

    "Can you generate comprehensive documentation for the 'processPayment' function in our 'PaymentService' module? Include parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Class Documentation">
    Ask for class-level documentation:

    "Please create documentation for the 'User' class, including descriptions of its properties, methods, and any important usage notes."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Module Overview">
    Request a module-level overview:

    "Can you provide a high-level overview of the 'AuthenticationModule', describing its purpose, main components, and how they interact?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Create README Files

Leverage Factory to generate or improve README files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project README">
    Ask Factory to create a main README file:

    "Based on our project structure and the code you've analyzed, can you generate a comprehensive README.md file for our project root directory?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sub-module READMEs">
    Request README files for sub-modules:

    "Can you create a README.md file for our 'utils' directory, explaining the purpose of each utility function and how to use them?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="README Refinement">
    Iterate on the generated READMEs:

    "The project README looks good, but can we add a section on how to set up the development environment and run tests?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Generate User Guides

Use Factory to create user-facing documentation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installation Guide">
    Request an installation guide:

    "Can you create a step-by-step installation guide for our project, including prerequisites and potential troubleshooting steps?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Usage Examples">
    Ask for usage examples:

    "Please provide a set of common usage examples for our main API endpoints. Include code snippets and explanations for each example."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration Guide">
    Request documentation on configuration options:

    "Can you generate documentation explaining all the configuration options in our 'config.json' file, including default values and when to change them?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 5. Document Architecture and Design

Use Factory to create high-level documentation of your system's architecture:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Architecture Overview">
    Ask for an architecture diagram and description:

    "Based on our codebase, can you create a high-level architecture diagram using Mermaid and provide a written description of the main components and their interactions?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Design Patterns">
    Request documentation on used design patterns:

    "Can you identify and document the key design patterns used in our project, explaining how and why they're implemented?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Flow">
    Ask for data flow documentation:

    "Please create a data flow diagram and accompanying explanation for our user authentication process."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 6. Maintain and Update Documentation

Leverage Factory to keep your documentation up-to-date:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Change Detection">
    Ask Factory to identify documentation that needs updates:

    "I've made changes to the 'UserService' module. Can you analyze these changes and identify which parts of our existing documentation need to be updated?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version-specific Docs">
    Request version-specific documentation updates:

    "We're preparing to release version 2.0 of our API. Can you help update our API documentation to reflect the changes in this new version?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deprecation Notices">
    Ask for help documenting deprecations:

    "We're deprecating the 'legacy\_api' module. Can you help draft deprecation notices and update the relevant documentation to guide users towards the new alternatives?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Documentation with Factory

1. **Consistency is Key**: Use Factory to maintain a consistent style and format across all documentation.

2. **Keep it Current**: Regularly ask Factory to review and suggest updates to your documentation as your codebase evolves.

3. **Audience-Centric Approach**: Clearly define your audience for each piece of documentation and ask Factory to tailor the content accordingly.

4. **Include Examples**: Always ask Factory to provide relevant code examples and use cases in your documentation.

5. **Link Related Docs**: Use Factory to help create a network of interlinked documentation for easy navigation.

6. **Versioning**: Maintain documentation versions that align with your software versions. Ask Factory how to structure this effectively.

7. **Incorporate Feedback**: Use Factory to help refine documentation based on user feedback and frequently asked questions.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Factory's AI capabilities, you can significantly streamline the process of creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation for your codebases. Remember that while Factory is a powerful tool for generating and organizing documentation, it's important to review and validate the output to ensure accuracy and relevance to your specific project needs.
