title: Core Development with Factory
description: Learn how to leverage Factory's AI capabilities to enhance your day-to-day software development tasks, from code generation to debugging and optimization
---

Factory can assist with various core development tasks, including code generation, refactoring, debugging, and optimization. This guide will walk you through how to effectively use Factory to enhance your productivity and code quality in everyday development scenarios.

## Getting Started

Before diving into core development tasks with Factory, ensure you have:

1. Access to Factory

2. Your development environment set up and connected to Factory

3. Familiarity with Factory's[ basic features](/user-guides/get-started/overview)

<Note>
  If you haven't set up Factory yet, refer to our [Quickstart Guide](/user-guides/get-started/quickstart) for quickstart instructions.
</Note>

## Core Development Tasks

### 1. Code Generation

Factory can help you quickly generate boilerplate code, implement design patterns, or create entire functions based on descriptions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the Functionality">
    Clearly describe what you want the code to do:

    "I need a Python function that takes a list of integers, filters out the even numbers, and returns the sum of the remaining odd numbers."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Requirements">
    Provide any specific requirements or constraints:

    "The function should use list comprehension and the built-in sum() function. Also, include type hints and a docstring."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Refine">
    Review the generated code and ask for refinements if needed:

    "The code looks good, but can you add error handling for non-integer inputs?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Code Refactoring

Use Factory to help improve existing code structure and readability.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify Refactoring Opportunities">
    Ask Factory to analyze your code:

    "Here's a Python class that handles user authentication. Can you identify any areas that could benefit from refactoring and explain why?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement Refactoring">
    Request specific refactoring actions:

    "Please refactor this class to use dependency injection for the database connection. Provide the refactored code and explain the benefits of this change."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Refactored Code">
    Ask Factory to explain the changes:

    "Can you walk me through the refactoring changes you made and how they improve the code's maintainability and testability?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Debugging Assistance

Leverage Factory to help identify and fix bugs in your code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the Bug">
    Clearly explain the issue you're encountering:

    "My Java method is throwing a NullPointerException, but I can't figure out why. Here's the method and the stack trace."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze the Code">
    Ask Factory to review the code and provide insights:

    "Can you analyze this code and suggest potential causes for the NullPointerException?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Fix">
    Request a solution to the bug:

    "Based on your analysis, can you provide a fix for this issue and explain how it prevents the NullPointerException?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Code Optimization

Use Factory to improve the performance and efficiency of your code.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify Performance Issues">
    Ask Factory to analyze your code for performance bottlenecks:

    "This JavaScript function is processing large arrays and seems slow. Can you identify any performance issues?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suggest Optimizations">
    Request optimization suggestions:

    "How can we optimize this function to handle large arrays more efficiently? Please provide an optimized version of the code."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Optimizations">
    Ask Factory to detail the improvements:

    "Can you explain the optimizations you made and why they improve performance? Include any trade-offs we should be aware of."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 5. Code Review Assistance

Leverage Factory to help with code review tasks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Code">
    Ask Factory to review a piece of code:

    "Can you review this Python function and provide feedback on code style, potential bugs, and adherence to best practices?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Suggest Improvements">
    Request specific improvement suggestions:

    "Based on your review, what changes would you recommend to improve this code's readability and maintainability?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explain Rationale">
    Ask Factory to explain its suggestions:

    "Can you explain the reasoning behind each of your suggested changes and how they align with Python best practices?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Core Development with Factory

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions of what you need. The more specific you are, the more accurate and helpful Factory's responses will be.

2. **Iterative Approach**: Use Factory iteratively. Start with a basic request and then refine based on the output.

3. **Context is Key**: Provide relevant context about your project, such as coding standards, architecture, or specific constraints. This helps Factory generate more appropriate code.

4. **Review and Understand**: Always review and understand the code generated by Factory. It's a tool to augment your skills, not replace them.

5. **Learn from Explanations**: When Factory provides explanations for its code or suggestions, use this as a learning opportunity to enhance your own understanding.

6. **Version Control Integration**: Consider how you can integrate Factory-generated code into your version control workflow. Always review changes before committing.

7. **Security Mindfulness**: When working on security-sensitive parts of your application, double-check Factory's suggestions against your security best practices.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Factory in your core development tasks, you can significantly enhance your productivity and code quality. Remember that while Factory is a powerful tool, it's meant to augment your skills and judgment as a developer, not replace them.
