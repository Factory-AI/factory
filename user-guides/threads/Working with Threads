## What are Threads?

Threads is Factory's intelligent context discovery system that automatically surfaces relevant information across your development ecosystem. When developers initiate a task, Threads automatically searches and correlates information from integrated platforms, eliminating manual context gathering and significantly reducing development time.

Threads allows you to dive directly into your project by searching for and aggregating:

* Codebases and files

* Pull Requests

* Product and Engineering Documentation

* Relevant Tickets

  <Step title="Platform Integration">
    Specify how your team likes to approach task breakdown:

    * Required information gathering

    * Estimation guidelines

    * Dependency mapping approach
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Context">
    Configure what information should be automatically available:

    * Relevant codebases

    * Documentation standards

    * Example tickets
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Templates">
    Define standardized formats for:

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

### Documentation Creation

* Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

* Technical Specifications

* API Documentation

### Project Management

* Breaking down features into tasks

* Creating sprint plans

* Estimating work efforts

* Managing dependencies

### Code Development

* Setting up new features

* Code review processes

* Testing procedures

* Deployment checklists

## Benefits of Using Workflows

### For Individual Developers

* Less context switching between tools

* Consistent access to relevant information

* Guided assistance through complex tasks

* Faster completion of routine work

### For Teams

* Standardized processes across projects

* Easier onboarding for new team members

* Captured institutional knowledge

* Reduced manual coordination

### For Organizations

* Enforced best practices

* Improved documentation quality

* Faster project initialization

* Consistent delivery standards

## Getting Started with Workflows

1. **Identify Repetitive Tasks**
   Look for processes you frequently repeat or guide others through

2. **Document Your Process**
   Write down the steps, required information, and expected outputs

3. **Create Your Workflow**
   Use Factory's workflow creator to formalize your process

4. **Share and Iterate**
   Get your team using the workflow and gather feedback for improvements
