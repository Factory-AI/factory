# GitHub Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts used by GitHub Actions workflows.

## generate-docs-map.py

Automatically generates a comprehensive documentation map (`docs/factory_docs_map.mdx`) that outlines all Factory documentation pages with their heading structure.

### Purpose

The documentation map is designed to:
- Provide an unlisted page that maps the entire documentation structure
- Help LLMs and AI assistants quickly understand and navigate the docs
- Automatically stay up-to-date through GitHub Actions

### How it works

1. Scans all `.md` and `.mdx` files in the `docs/` directory
2. Extracts frontmatter (title, description) and heading structure from each file
3. Organizes documentation by top-level directory groups
4. Generates a hierarchical map with links to full documentation
5. Updates the timestamp to track when it was last generated

### Trigger

The documentation map is automatically regenerated by the `generate-docs-map.yml` workflow whenever:
- Documentation files (`.md` or `.mdx`) are modified
- The generator script itself is updated
- The workflow is manually triggered

### Inspired by

This approach is inspired by [Claude Code's documentation map](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude_code_docs_map), which provides a similar comprehensive overview of their documentation structure.
