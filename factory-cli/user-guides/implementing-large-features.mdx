title: Implementing Large Features
description: A systematic approach to tackling complex, multi-phase development projects using specification planning and iterative implementation.
---

Large-scale features require careful planning and systematic execution to avoid overwhelming complexity. This guide outlines a proven workflow for breaking down massive projects into manageable phases, using specification mode for planning and iterative implementation with frequent validation.

## When to use this workflow

This approach is ideal for:

**Massive refactors** - Touching 100+ files across your entire codebase

```
"Migrate from REST API to GraphQL across all frontend components"
```

**Major component migrations** - Replacing core system dependencies

```
"Switch from Stripe to a new billing provider across the entire payment system"
```

**Large feature implementations** - New functionality spanning 30+ files

```
"Add comprehensive user roles and permissions system to the existing application"
```

## The workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the master plan">
    Use Specification Mode to create comprehensive documentation breaking the
    project into major phases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase-by-phase implementation">
    Start new sessions for each phase, referencing the master plan document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Frequent commits and PRs">
    Create git commits and pull requests corresponding to each completed phase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incremental validation">
    Test and validate functionality after each phase rather than at the end.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the plan">
    Mark completed phases and adjust remaining work based on learnings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 1: Master planning with Specification Mode

Start by using **Shift+Tab** to enter Specification Mode and create a comprehensive breakdown:

**Example prompt:**

```
Create a detailed implementation plan for migrating our entire authentication system
from Firebase Auth to Auth0. This affects user login, registration, session management,
role-based access control, and integrations across 50+ components.

Break this into major phases that can be implemented independently with clear
testing and validation points. Each phase should be completable in 1-2 days
and have minimal dependencies on other phases.
```

**Specification Mode will generate:**

- **Phase breakdown** - 4-6 major implementation phases
- **Dependencies mapping** - Which phases must be completed before others
- **Testing strategy** - How to validate each phase works correctly
- **Risk assessment** - Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Rollback plan** - How to safely revert if needed

**Save the plan** - Approve the specification and save it as `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in your project root.

## Phase 2: Iterative implementation

For each phase in your plan:

### Start a fresh session

Begin each phase with a new droid session to maintain focus and clean context.

### Reference the master plan

**Example prompt for Phase 1:**

```
I'm implementing Phase 1 of the authentication migration plan documented in
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

Phase 1 focuses on setting up Auth0 configuration and creating the basic
authentication service without affecting existing Firebase integration.

Please read the plan document and implement this phase, then update the
document to mark Phase 1 as complete.
```

### Use Specification Mode for complex phases

For phases involving significant changes, use **Shift+Tab** to get detailed planning:

```
Following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, implement Phase 3: Update all login components
to use the new Auth0 service while maintaining backward compatibility with
the existing Firebase auth as fallback.
```

### Commit frequently

After each phase completion, ask Droid to commit your changes:

```
Commit all changes for Phase 1 of the auth migration with a detailed message.
```

```
Create a commit for the Auth0 service setup work with bullet points for each major change.
```

Droid will stage all changes and create the commit with proper co-authorship attribution.

### Create phase-specific PRs

Ask Droid to create pull requests for each completed phase:

```
Create a PR for the auth migration Phase 1 work on a new branch called auth-migration-phase-1.
```

```
Open a pull request with a comprehensive description of what was completed and testing done.
```

Droid will create the branch, push the changes, and generate a detailed PR description based on the commits and changes made.

## Phase 3: Validation and testing strategy

### Test each phase independently

Don't wait until the end - validate functionality after each phase:

**Phase 1 completion:**

```
Run the authentication tests and verify the Auth0 service works in isolation.
Test user registration, login, and logout with the new service.
```

**Phase 2 completion:**

```
Test the migration script with a subset of test users. Verify data integrity
and that users can log in with both old and new systems.
```

### Use feature flags for gradual rollout

```
Add a feature flag for auth0-migration with 10% rollout that can be controlled by environment variable.
```

```
Implement progressive rollout logic using feature flags to gradually migrate users from Firebase to Auth0.
```

### Automated testing at phase boundaries

```
Run the full test suite after each phase including unit, integration, and e2e tests.
```

```
Set up automated testing that validates auth migration functionality at each phase boundary.
```

## Best practices

**Start with read-only changes** - Begin phases with analysis and preparation before making modifications.

**Maintain backward compatibility** - Keep old systems working while new ones are being built.

**Use feature toggles** - Allow gradual rollout and quick rollback if needed.

**Document learnings** - Update your plan based on discoveries during implementation.

**Test boundary conditions** - Focus testing on the interfaces between old and new systems.

**Plan for rollback** - Each phase should be reversible if critical issues are discovered.

**Communicate progress** - Keep stakeholders updated with regular progress reports.

## Recovery strategies

If a phase encounters major issues:

1. **Immediate rollback** - Use git to revert to the last stable state
2. **Issue analysis** - Document what went wrong and why
3. **Plan adjustment** - Update remaining phases based on learnings
4. **Stakeholder communication** - Update timelines and expectations

The systematic approach ensures large features are delivered reliably while maintaining code quality and system stability throughout the process.
