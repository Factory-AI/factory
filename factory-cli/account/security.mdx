description: How Factory CLI keeps your code and data secure with built-in protections and best practices.
---

## Security-First Design

Factory CLI (Droid) is built with security at its core. Your code stays secure through encrypted authentication, strict permissions, and enterprise-grade protections.

## Key Security Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Authentication" icon="shield-check">
    OAuth login with encrypted token storage. Tokens auto-rotate every 30 days and are stored with OS-level file permissions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permission Controls" icon="user-lock">
    All risky operations require explicit approval. Configure tool permissions from allow/ask/reject per your security needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
    All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256 with AWS KMS). Factory never trains on your code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Execution" icon="computer">
    Shell commands and file edits run locally. Only necessary context and diffs are sent to Factory's secure cloud.

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Always review suggested code and commands before approval. You control what Droid can access and execute.
</Warning>

### Essential Security Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review before approving">
    **Always verify proposed commands and file changes**, especially:
    - Commands that install packages or modify system files
    - Operations involving sensitive data or credentials  
    - Network requests to external services
    - File operations outside your project directory
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use isolated environments">
    **Run Droid in containers or VMs** when working with:
    - Untrusted code repositories
    - External APIs or web services
    - Experimental or potentially risky operations
    - Shared development environments
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manage permissions carefully">
    **Configure tool permissions** to match your security requirements:
    - Set high-risk commands to "reject" by default
    - Use "ask" for medium-risk operations requiring oversight
    - Only "allow" low-risk commands you trust completely
    - Review permissions regularly with the Settings menu
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Protect sensitive data">
    **Never include secrets in prompts:**
    - Use environment variables for API keys and tokens
    - Store credentials in secure credential managers
    - Exclude sensitive files from Droid's working directory
    - Use the FACTORY_TOKEN environment variable for CI/CD
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Built-in Protections

Factory CLI includes multiple layers of security:

- **Write access restriction**: Can only modify files in the project directory and subdirectories
- **Command approval**: Risky operations require explicit user confirmation
- **Prompt injection detection**: Analyzes requests for potentially harmful instructions
- **Network request controls**: Web-fetching tools require approval by default
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection attacks
- **Session isolation**: Each conversation maintains separate, secure context
