Factory 1.6 introduces a new To-Do List Tool for multi-step work, several improvements to remote Droids, plus Browser Tools to navigate and interact with the web from Factory.

### To-do list tool

Keep longer tasks on track. The to-do list tool creates a live checklist that Droids follow and update as work progresses.

**How it works**

Droids break a goal into ordered tasks with clear acceptance criteria. Progress is tracked automatically as the agent runs. You can ask the Droid to add, remove, or edit tasks at any time.

### Improved remote Droids

Quicker connection and command execution, as well as improved reliability when using remote Droids means snappier sessions when working with this type of machine connection.

### Browser tools

Droids can now browse and interact with websites and internal tools via Factory Bridge. Capabilities include:

- Navigate, click, fill forms, upload files, and extract text, links and tables.
- Traverse observability stacks to reproduce issues and gather evidence for RCAs.
- Validate user flows and test local changes to web applications.

Getting started with browser tools:

- Update Bridge, connect to a Local Machine and enable browser tools. The session will then be able to navigate relevant websites using a local browser instance.

### Additional Improvements

- **Google Docs importing** — better parsing and text extraction, including table of contents support.
- **Bridge search** — ripgrep is now bundled for fast, reliable local search across repos.
- **Context in dashboard** — fixed context creation errors when pasting integration URLs.
- **Workspace and repos** — more reliable repo-root detection and refresh flows (parallel token and env fetch).

### Bug Fixes & Stability

- **Data integrity** — enforced message size and image count limits; truncated oversized outputs to prevent datastore or model errors.
- **Error clarity** — expanded error taxonomy and consistent categorization for easier diagnostics.
- **Memory quality** — improved precision so broadly useful details are remembered while task-specific noise is reduced.
