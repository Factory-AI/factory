Factory 1.4 introduces Droids into Slack and delivers key improvements to onboarding and overall user experience. 


### Slack Support

Droids can now read and write to your channels streamlining team workflows.

#### How it works

Connect your Slack workspace via the **Settings** page in Factory. Next, add the Factory app to any channel by typing **/invite** Factory in Slack. Once connected, Droids can see your channels, read conversations, and send messages to you and your team. Slack links shared with Droids are securely parsed to deliver context-aware actions.

#### How teams are using it

1. **Incident Timeline Snapshots** – Summarize an incident thread into a concise status briefing and have your Droid turn it into an RCA to send back to Slack.
2. **Conversation Digest** – Scan recent engineering channel activity to surface emerging themes.
3. **Decision Extraction** – Convert long discussion threads into compact decision notes (context, choice, rationale, impacted components).
