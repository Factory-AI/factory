## Skills

Extend Droid with modular, reusable capabilities. Skills are knowledge packs combined with custom tools that Droid can invoke when needed.

**How it works**

Type `/skills` to browse, enable, or create new skills. Skills live in `.factory/skills` directories—save them globally in your home directory (`~/.factory/skills`) for personal use, or keep them project-specific in your repo to share with your team.

Droid automatically picks up your skills and uses them when relevant. If you're coming from Claude Code, Droid detects and imports skills from `.claude/skills` directories automatically.

**What you can do**

- Create custom skills for your team's workflows
- Share skills across projects
- Store skills globally or per-project

## Interactive code review

Review code changes without leaving the CLI. The `/review` command provides a flexible workflow for examining diffs, commits, and branches.

**How it works**

Type `/review` to start an interactive code review. Choose from multiple review modes:

- **Compare against base branch** - Review all changes relative to main or another branch
- **Review specific commits** - Examine individual commits in detail
- **Uncommitted changes** - Review your working directory changes before committing
- **Custom instructions** - Provide specific review criteria or focus areas

Droid analyzes the code changes and provides detailed feedback, catching issues before they reach pull requests.

## Custom models for subagents

Subagents can now use their own models. Instead of inheriting from your main session, configure each subagent to use a specific model.

**How it works**

Open `/droids` and select a subagent. Change the model field to use any available model—faster models for simple tasks, more capable ones for complex analysis.

**Use cases**

- Use a fast model for quick file searches
- Use a reasoning model for security reviews
- Optimize cost by matching model capability to task complexity
