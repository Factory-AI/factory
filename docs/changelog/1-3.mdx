Factory 1.3 comes with improvements on the speed, quality, and reliability of Droids. Commands run faster, Droids pull in context in a more targeted and precise way, and prompt caching is significantly more effective.


### Fast Execution – 40% Droid Speed Boost

Droids work faster due to improvements in context compression and prompt caching. In turn, sessions for long-duration tasks are significantly faster and more efficient.


### Bridge V2 – Native installers, sturdier connection

Bridge V2 is significantly more persistent, strengthening session connection across multiple tabs. MacOS Bridge now has a .dmg for easier installation. Windows Bridge improvements include PowerShell-based env loading and fixes on bugs and papercuts.


### Partial File Viewing & CLI Precision

Droids now have more precise tool-calling ability to view partial files and outputs, leading to more efficient token usage and higher quality output.
