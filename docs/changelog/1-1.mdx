Windows developers can now execute code on their local machine with Factory Bridge. Run local CLI from chat and sync code between your desktop and Factory. Along with native Windows support, we're rolling out a 50% boost in token efficiency, support for creating remote workspaces hosted in GitLab, sharper UI flows, and more predictable billing.


### Windows Support for Factory Bridge

Bring Factory's frontier agent-native development experience to your Windows machine. Run npm test, edit files in VSCode, or ship binaries. Factory mirrors every change to your workspace and keeps context current.

- **How it works**:
  1. Download the Factory Bridge from Connect > Local Machine in the top-right corner of a Factory session.
  2. Download the setup.exe installer.
  3. Upon opening the installer, Factory Bridge will be installed on your machine.

### 50% Increase in Token Efficiency
