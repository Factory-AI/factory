Factory 1.5 introduces a fully redesigned Session interface, transforming how you manage your Droids.


### Session Revamp

The entire agentic workflow in Sessions has been rebuilt and simplified to reduce friction and keep you in control:

- **Specification:** Start with a distraction-free, chat-only workspace to define scope, boundaries, and success criteria—without side panels stealing focus.
- **Management:** Open the Context view to see exactly what your Droid sees (code files, memory, and uploaded docs).
- **Review:** Once your Droid makes a change, jump directly to the relevant unified diff. See every edit in one continuous flow with clear highlights and headers summarizing lines changed and file status.


### Additional Improvements

- **Upgraded Slack Tools** – New tools to read Slack channels and fetch Slack threads, now with improved reliability and messages auto-formatted as Markdown.
- **Model Updates** – GPT-5 (Mini and Nano variants) now available, integrated with OpenAI’s Responses API for smoother streaming, better tool calls, and improved error handling. Claude Opus 4.1 model refresh is also live.
- **Excel Support** – Parse and import .xlsx files directly in Factory.


### Bug Fixes & Stability

- Faster, more responsive chat input (especially in Chrome).
- More reliable Windows Bridge connectivity.
