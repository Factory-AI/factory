In this Quickstart Guide, you'll use Factory to Q&A your codebase, create a feature, and save it down to your local files.

<Note>
  Make sure you have access to Factory before getting started.
</Note>

## Step 1: Open Factory and Create a Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Factory">
    Open the Factory application in your browser.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Droid">
    Select the appropriate Droid based on your project needs.

    <Note>
      Note, that each Droid is provisioned highly specific system prompts and tools that make them particularly adept at certain tasks.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your Model and Tools">
    Select your desired Model and activate the necessary Tools for your task.

    <Note>
      Tools extend the functionality of the Factory Droids beyond the Factory platform. The Github tool, for example, creates a bi-directional integration with Github/Gitlab while our Project Management tool does the same with Jira/Linear.

      See our [**Integrations guide**](https://docs.factory.ai/onboarding/integrating-with-your-engineering-system/github-cloud) to connect your Github/Gitlab and Jira/Linear.
