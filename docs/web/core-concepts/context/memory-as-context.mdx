title: Memory as Context
description: How Factory's memory system provides persistent, evolving context across all your sessions
---

## Overview
Memory is a special type of context in Factory that persists across sessions and evolves as you work. Unlike external integration context (which you manually add) or dynamic repository context (which the droid retrieves per session), memory context is automatically maintained and updated by Factory to capture stable knowledge about your workflows, preferences, and team conventions.

As you work, Factory quietly records important facts—branch naming patterns, acronyms, coding preferences—and stores them in either **User Memory** (private to you) or **Organization Memory** (shared with your team). This memory context is automatically included in every session, ensuring consistent understanding without repeated explanations.

## Memory in the Context Ecosystem

Memory complements other context types to provide a complete picture:

  <Card title="Session Context" icon="clock">
    **Temporary & Task-Specific**
    - External integrations (tickets, PRs)
    - Dynamic code retrieval
    - Current conversation
    - Cleared when session ends
  </Card>

  <Card title="Memory Context" icon="brain">
    **Persistent & Evolving**
    - User preferences & patterns
    - Team conventions & standards
    - Accumulated knowledge
    - Carries across all sessions

  <Card title="Combined Power" icon="link">
    **Complete Understanding**
    - Memory provides the "how"
    - Session context provides the "what"
    - Together: Full task comprehension
    - Minimal repetition needed

## Key Benefits
Memory as persistent context helps Factory work more effectively:

- **Work more autonomously** – Factory learns your patterns and conventions, so it can complete larger tasks without stopping to ask for clarification.  
- **Scale tribal knowledge instantly** – Solutions discovered by one engineer automatically become available to the whole team. New engineers benefit from accumulated knowledge immediately.  
- **Focus on solving problems, not explaining context** – No need to repeatedly mention that your API uses snake_case or that incidents go to #pagerduty. Factory remembers.  
- **Context-switch without losing momentum** – Your preferences, branch-naming patterns, and project vocabulary persist across sessions and devices.  

## What Memory May Store
The assistant focuses on facts that are hard to derive from code and that stay useful over time:

- Personal preferences such as explanation depth, coding style, or favourite tools  
- Frequently used commands and repeatable workflows  
- Team or organisation terms, acronyms, and domain language  
- Standard processes, conventions, and best-practice tips  
- Pointers to key resources or escalation contacts  
- Stable project facts like default branches or staging URLs

## How Memory Works
<Steps>

  <Step title="1. Detect">
    The assistant recognises statements that will remain useful across sessions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Store">
    A concise note is saved to User or Organization Memory—no pop-ups, no interruptions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Retrieve">
    At the start of each session, relevant memory lines blend with live context to guide replies.
  </Step>

</Steps>

| Scope | Visible To | Examples | Who Can Edit |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **User Memory** | Only you | “Prefers bullet summaries”; “default branch = dev” | You |
| **Organization Memory** | Everyone in organization | “Incident channel = #pagerduty” | Organization Admins |

## Working With Memory

### Adding New Facts
- **Tell Factory directly** – e.g. “Remember that our staging URL is \<staging_url\>.”  
- **Specify the scope** – Optionally, add “for the team” or “just for me” to guide where it’s stored.

### Viewing & Editing
- Open the **Context Panel** and select a **Memory** context item.  
- View the memory content as rendered markdown. 
- Switch to code view to edit memory directly. Click the save icon when done. *(Editing Organization Memory requires Admin privileges)*

### Opting Out
- Use the **Toolkit Selector** to toggle **Memory** off.  
- While disabled, nothing is stored or surfaced for that session; toggle back on at any time.

## Security & Privacy
- Scoped visibility enforces private vs shared access with role-based editing  
- Users can opt out at any time via the Memory toolkit toggle  
- Lines can be edited or deleted whenever needed

## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The assistant still asks for info I already gave">
Memory may be toggled off in this session, or the statement was judged too temporary. Check the toolkit toggle and the Memory tab.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can’t see the Memory tab">
Memory may be disabled in the Toolkit selector. Ensure the Memory toggle is on.
