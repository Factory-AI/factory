title: External Integration Context
description: Understanding and managing external resources like tickets, pull requests, and incidents in Factory
---

## Overview

External integration context refers to resources from your connected tools and platforms that you manually add to your Factory sessions. These provide crucial background information, requirements, and discussions that help Factory understand the full scope of your work.

<Note>
  External context is **manually added** by you when needed, giving you full control over what information Factory considers for each task.

## How to Add External Context

### Method 1: Using @ Commands

The fastest way to add external context is through @ commands in the chat:

```
@ticket PROJ-123
@pull request #456
@google docs [paste link]
@notion [paste link]
```

<Tip>
  Start typing @ to see available commands and auto-complete suggestions based on your connected integrations.
</Tip>

### Method 2: Direct Link Pasting

Simply paste URLs directly into the chat, and Factory will automatically recognize and fetch the content:

```
https://linear.app/company/issue/PROJ-123
https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456
https://docs.google.com/document/d/...
https://notion.so/workspace/page-id
```

### Method 3: Context Panel

Use the Context Panel to browse and add resources:

1. Click the **Context** button in the chat interface
2. Select **Add Context** 
3. Choose your integration type
4. Search or browse for the resource
5. Click to add to your session

## Best Practices

### When to Add External Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="At Task Start">
    Add relevant tickets, PRs, and documentation when beginning work to establish full context upfront.
  </Step>

  <Step title="During Investigation">
    Add related issues, past PRs, or incident reports when debugging or researching solutions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="For Review">
    Include PR descriptions, review comments, and related changes when conducting code reviews.
  </Step>

  <Step title="For Planning">
    Add requirements documents, design specs, and technical documentation when planning implementations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing External Context

<Warning>
  External context persists throughout your session. Remove outdated or irrelevant context to maintain optimal performance.
</Warning>

**Do's:**
- ✅ Add context relevant to your current task
- ✅ Include related tickets and PRs for full picture
- ✅ Update context when requirements change
- ✅ Remove context when switching tasks

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Add every available resource "just in case"
- ❌ Keep outdated tickets from previous tasks
- ❌ Include entire documentation sites
- ❌ Add private or sensitive information unnecessarily

## Integration Requirements

To use external context, you need to connect your accounts:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Connect the services you use:
   - GitHub/GitLab for PRs and issues
   - Jira/Linear for project management
   - Google/Notion for documentation
   - PagerDuty/Sentry for incidents
   - Slack for team communications
3. Authorize Factory to access your data

<Note>
  Factory only accesses data when you explicitly add it to a session. We don't automatically scan or index your external tools.
</Note>

## Security & Privacy

- **On-Demand Access**: Content is only fetched when you explicitly add it
- **Session Scoped**: External context is isolated to individual sessions
- **Access Controls**: Respects your permissions in connected tools
- **Audit Trail**: All context additions are logged for security
