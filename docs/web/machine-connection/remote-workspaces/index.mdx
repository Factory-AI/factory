title: Remote Workspaces
description: Spin-up instant, cloud-hosted workspaces that mirror your local dev setup—no install required

Remote workspaces let you code **anywhere** without the “works on my machine” dance. Each workspace is a pre-configured environment that lives in the cloud, boots in seconds and can be customized to run setup commands.
## Why use remote workspaces?

| Benefit           | What it means for you                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zero setup**    | Open a session and start coding—no local installs or VM juggling.                                       |
| **Consistency**   | Every teammate (and CI job) runs the _exact_ same environment.                                          |
| **Speed**         | Heavy builds run on powerful cloud CPUs; your laptop fan stays silent.                                  |
| **Isolation**     | Experiments live in disposable workspaces, keeping your local machine clean.                            |
| **Collaboration** | Share a workspace link; reviewers jump into the _live_ environment with code and ports already running. |
