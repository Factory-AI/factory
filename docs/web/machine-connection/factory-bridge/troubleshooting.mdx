  </Step>
</Steps>

### Command Returns Error

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found">
    If you see "command not found" errors:

    1. Verify the command is installed on your system by trying it directly in a terminal
    2. Check if the command is in your system PATH

## Process Management Issues

### Can't Find Process ID (PID)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate Process Information">
    When a process is started through Factory Bridge, the PID is returned in the response:

    ```json

    }
    ```

    Look for this information in Factory's response after starting a process.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check If Process Is Still Running">
    Verify if the process is still running:

    ```
    ps -p 12345
    ```

    If the process has already terminated, you'll need to start a new one.

</Steps>

### Process Terminates Unexpectedly
