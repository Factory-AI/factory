title: Auto-Run Mode
description: Enable automatic execution of file edits and creation without manual approval for faster development workflows.
---

Auto-Run Mode eliminates the need for manual confirmation when droid makes file changes. Instead of stopping to ask for approval before each edit or file creation, droid automatically executes these changes, creating a seamless and faster development experience.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto-Run">
    Activate Auto-Run Mode in the CLI or through settings to bypass file operation confirmations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Droid makes changes">
    When droid needs to edit or create files, it executes these operations immediately without waiting for your approval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the results">
    See all changes as they happen in real-time, with full visibility into what was modified or created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review when complete">
    Once the task is finished, review all changes at once rather than approving each individual operation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example workflow

**Normal mode:**
```
Droid: "I need to edit config.js to add the new API endpoint"
You: [Approve] ✓
Droid: "I need to create a new routes/api.js file"
You: [Approve] ✓
Droid: "I need to update package.json with the new dependency"
You: [Approve] ✓
```

**Auto-Run mode:**
```
Droid: "Adding new API endpoint..."
✓ Edited config.js
✓ Created routes/api.js  
✓ Updated package.json
Task complete!
```

<Note>
Auto-Run Mode can be toggled on/off at any time during your session. It only affects file editing and creation operations.
</Note>

## How to enable Auto-Run Mode

**In the CLI:** Use the keyboard shortcut **Shift+Tab** to toggle Auto-Run Mode on or off during your session.

**From Specification Mode:** When approving a specification, choose "Approve and continue with auto-run enabled" to automatically enable Auto-Run for the implementation.

## What Auto-Run affects

**Automatically executed:**
- Creating new files
- Editing existing files  
- Saving file changes

**Still requires approval:**
- Running shell commands
- Installing packages
- Making git commits
- Deleting files or directories

Auto-Run Mode is designed specifically for the most common and safe file operations that developers typically want to happen quickly.

## When to use Auto-Run Mode

**Perfect for:**
- Refactoring across multiple files
- Adding features that span several components
- Code cleanup and formatting tasks
- Generating boilerplate code
- Applying consistent changes across your codebase

**Consider normal mode for:**
- Working with unfamiliar codebases
- Making changes to critical system files
- When you want to review each change individually
- Learning how droid approaches problems

## Safety features

Auto-Run Mode includes built-in safety measures:

**File operation limits:** Droid will pause and ask for confirmation if it needs to modify an unusually large number of files (typically 20+).

**Critical file protection:** Changes to package.json, configuration files, and other critical files may still prompt for approval depending on the scope.

**Easy toggle:** You can instantly disable Auto-Run Mode with Shift+Tab if you want to return to manual approval.

**Full visibility:** Every change is logged and displayed as it happens, so you always know what's being modified.

## Example use cases

**Multi-file refactoring:**
```
"Rename the UserService class to AccountService throughout the codebase"
```

With Auto-Run enabled, droid will automatically:
- Update all import statements
- Rename the class file
- Modify all references in components
- Update related tests

**Feature implementation:**
```
"Add user authentication to the existing API endpoints"
```

Droid will automatically create and edit the necessary files for:
- Middleware functions
- Route protections  
- Database schema updates
- Test files

**Code organization:**
```
"Move all utility functions to a shared utils directory"
```

Auto-Run handles:
- Creating the new directory structure
- Moving files to appropriate locations
- Updating all import paths
- Maintaining code functionality
