## What `droid` brings to your workflow

- **End-to-end feature development**: From planning to implementation to testing - droid handles the complete development lifecycle while keeping you in control through transparent review workflows.
- **Deep codebase understanding**: Leverages your organization's shared knowledge across repositories, documentation, and issue tracking to provide contextually aware assistance that improves over time.
- **Engineering system integration**: Connects directly to your existing tools — with native integrations to Jira, Notion, Slack, and many more tools — so development work stays synchronized with your team's processes.
- **Production-ready automation**: Deploy the same workflows locally during development or in CI/CD pipelines, with enterprise security and compliance built-in from day one.

## Why teams choose Factory

- **Built for enterprise**: On-premise deployment options, SOC-2 compliance, and air-gapped environments. We prioritize security and quality over racing to the lowest price point.
- **Your tools, enhanced**: Works within your existing terminal, IDE, and development environment. No need to switch editors or learn new interfaces — droid integrates where you're already productive.
- **Transparent and controllable**: Every decision droid makes is visible and reviewable. You maintain full oversight of code changes with our native diff viewer and approval workflows.
- **Model flexibility**: Not locked into a single AI provider. Factory allows you to route tasks to the best model for each job while maintaining consistent behavior and memory across your organization.
