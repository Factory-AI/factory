## Pricing Tiers

Factory measures usage through Standard Tokens. Cached tokens are billed at one-tenth of a Standard Token (10 cached tokens = 1 Standard Token). We offer two subscription plans:

| Plan | Standard Tokens / Month | Price / Month |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Pro** | 20 million | $20 |
| **Max** | 200 million | $200 |

Overage is billed at $2.70 per million tokens.

## Model Pricing

Different models have different multipliers applied to calculate Standard Token usage.
