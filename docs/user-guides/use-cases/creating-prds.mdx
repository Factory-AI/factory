Creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a crucial step in the product development process. Factory can help you organize ideas, generate detailed requirements, and ensure clarity and completeness in your PRDs. This guide will walk you through the process of using Factory to build effective PRDs.

## Getting Started

Before diving into PRD creation with Factory, ensure you have:

1. Access to Factory

2. A clear understanding of your product vision and goals

3. Any existing product documentation or notes

## PRD Creation Workflow

### 1. Define Product Vision and Scope

Start by outlining the high-level vision and scope of your product:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Product Vision">
    Ask Factory to help articulate your product vision:

    "Can you help me craft a concise product vision statement for our new mobile banking app? The key goals are security, ease of use, and personalized financial insights."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Target Audience">
    Define your target audience:

    "Based on our product vision, can you help me describe our primary target audience and their key characteristics?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scope Definition">
    Clarify the scope of your product:

    "Let's define the scope for our mobile banking app. What core features should be included in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and what should be considered for future releases?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Generate Detailed Requirements

Use Factory to break down high-level goals into detailed requirements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Functional Requirements">
    Ask Factory to generate functional requirements:

    "Based on our product vision and scope, can you generate a list of functional requirements for the user authentication feature of our mobile banking app?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-Functional Requirements">
    Request non-functional requirements:

    "What non-functional requirements should we consider for our mobile banking app, focusing on security, performance, and usability?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Stories">
    Generate user stories:

    "Can you create user stories for the 'view account balance' feature of our mobile banking app?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Define Acceptance Criteria

Leverage Factory to create clear, testable acceptance criteria:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature-Level Criteria">
    Ask for acceptance criteria for specific features:

    "Please provide acceptance criteria for the 'transfer funds' feature in our mobile banking app."
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Story Criteria">
    Request acceptance criteria for user stories:

    "For the 'view account balance' user story, what would be appropriate acceptance criteria?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Refine">
    Iterate on the generated criteria:

    "The acceptance criteria look good, but can we add a specific criterion about response time for balance inquiries?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Create Mockups and Wireframes

While Factory can't create visual designs, it can help describe and plan them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="UI Description">
    Ask Factory to describe UI elements:

    "Can you provide a detailed description of the user interface elements needed for the 'transfer funds' feature?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Flow">
    Request user flow descriptions:

    "Describe the ideal user flow for setting up a new payee in our mobile banking app."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 5. Prioritize Features

Use Factory to help prioritize features and requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prioritization Criteria">
    Define prioritization criteria:

    "What criteria should we consider when prioritizing features for our mobile banking app MVP?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Feature Ranking">
    Ask Factory to rank features:

    "Based on our prioritization criteria, can you rank the top 5 features for our MVP in order of importance?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Roadmap Planning">
    Request help with roadmap planning:

    "Can you suggest a high-level product roadmap for the first three releases of our mobile banking app, based on our prioritized features?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 6. Document Assumptions and Constraints

Capture important assumptions and constraints:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify Assumptions">
    Ask Factory to help identify assumptions:

    "What key assumptions should we document regarding user behavior and technology adoption for our mobile banking app?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="List Constraints">
    Request a list of potential constraints:

    "Can you help me identify and list potential technical, regulatory, and resource constraints for our mobile banking app project?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 7. Compile and Format the PRD

Use Factory to help structure and format your PRD:

<Steps>
  <Step title="PRD Template">
    Request a PRD template:

    "Can you provide a comprehensive template for our mobile banking app PRD, including all the sections we've discussed?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Organization">
    Ask for help organizing the content:

    "Based on the information we've gathered, can you help me organize it into a logical structure within the PRD template?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Executive Summary">
    Request an executive summary:

    "Can you draft an executive summary for our mobile banking app PRD, highlighting the key points from each section?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
