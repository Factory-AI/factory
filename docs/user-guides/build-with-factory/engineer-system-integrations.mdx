Factory's power lies not just in its AI capabilities, but also in its ability to seamlessly integrate with your existing engineering tools and resources. By simply sharing links in the chat interface, you can bring valuable context from various sources directly into your Factory sessions.

## Supported Integrations

Factory can retrieve and incorporate information from a variety of external sources:

* Project Management Tools (e.g., Jira, Linear)

* Version Control Systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)

* Web Resources

* Documentation Platforms (e.g., Confluence)

Let's explore how to use each of these integrations and the benefits they bring to your workflow.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share a Link">

## Best Practices for Using Integrations

1. **Start with Context**: Begin your session by sharing relevant links to set the proper context for your task.

2. **Combine Multiple Sources**: Don't hesitate to share links from different systems to provide comprehensive context.

3. **Ask Specific Questions**: After sharing a link, ask Factory specific questions about the content to leverage the newly added context.

4. **Update as You Go**: As your task evolves, share new or updated links to keep the context current.

5. **Verify Sensitive Information**: While Factory securely handles information, always double-check before sharing links containing sensitive data.

## Conclusion

By leveraging these integrations, you can create a more connected and context-rich development environment within Factory. This not only enhances the AI's ability to assist you but also streamlines your workflow by bringing various tools and resources into a single, intelligent interface.
