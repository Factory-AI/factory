title: Understanding Memory
description: Factory's agentic knowledge layer that remembers your workflow and team conventions
---

## Overview
Memory is Factory's agentic knowledge layer that continuously builds a persistent understanding of your development patterns.  
As you work, the assistant quietly records stable facts—branch names, acronyms, release cadences—and places them in either **User Memory** (private) or **Organization Memory** (shared). Relevant lines are injected at the start of each chat so replies arrive with built-in context and fewer follow-ups.

## Key Benefits
Memory helps Factory understand your context and work more effectively across sessions:

- **Work more autonomously** – Factory learns your patterns and conventions, so it can complete larger tasks without stopping to ask for clarification.  
- **Scale tribal knowledge instantly** – Solutions discovered by one engineer automatically become available to the whole team. New engineers benefit from accumulated knowledge immediately.  
- **Focus on solving problems, not explaining context** – No need to repeatedly mention that your API uses snake_case or that incidents go to #pagerduty. Factory remembers.  
- **Context-switch without losing momentum** – Your preferences, branch-naming patterns, and project vocabulary persist across sessions and devices.  

## What Memory May Store
The assistant focuses on facts that are hard to derive from code and that stay useful over time:

- Personal preferences such as explanation depth, coding style, or favourite tools  
- Frequently used commands and repeatable workflows  
- Team or organisation terms, acronyms, and domain language  
- Standard processes, conventions, and best-practice tips  
- Pointers to key resources or escalation contacts  
- Stable project facts like default branches or staging URLs  

> Note: Secrets, passwords, and API keys are **not** saved. A security layer filters them out automatically.

## How Memory Works
<Steps>

  <Step title="1. Detect">
    The assistant recognises statements that will remain useful across sessions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Store">
    A concise note is saved to User or Organization Memory—no pop-ups, no interruptions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Retrieve">
    At the start of each session, relevant memory lines blend with live context to guide replies.
  </Step>

</Steps>

| Scope | Visible To | Examples | Who Can Edit |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **User Memory** | Only you | “Prefers bullet summaries”; “default branch = dev” | You |
| **Organization Memory** | Everyone in organization | “Incident channel = #pagerduty” | Organization Admins |

## Working With Memory

### Adding New Facts
- **Tell Factory directly** – e.g. “Remember that our staging URL is \<staging_url\>.”  
- **Specify the scope** – Optionally, add “for the team” or “just for me” to guide where it’s stored.

### Viewing & Editing
- Open the **Context Panel** and select a **Memory** context item.  
- View the memory content as rendered markdown. 
- Switch to code view to edit memory directly. Click the save icon when done. *(Editing Organization Memory requires Admin privileges)*

### Opting Out
- Use the **Toolkit Selector** to toggle **Memory** off.  
- While disabled, nothing is stored or surfaced for that session; toggle back on at any time.

### Downloading a Copy
- Click **Download** in the Memory tab to save a Markdown snapshot of the current User or Organization Memory.

## Security & Privacy
- Encrypted at rest and in transit  
- Secret-scrub removes API keys and similar credentials before storage  
- Scoped visibility enforces private vs shared access with role-based editing  
- Users can opt out at any time via the Memory toolkit toggle  
- Lines can be edited or deleted whenever needed

## FAQ
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The assistant still asks for info I already gave">
Memory may be toggled off in this session, or the statement was judged too temporary. Check the toolkit toggle and the Memory tab.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can’t see the Memory tab">
Memory may be disabled in the Toolkit selector. Ensure the Memory toggle is on.

<Accordion title="How do I remove outdated details?">
