description: A ready-to-run remote workspace template for modern React & TypeScript projects

Spin up a fully-featured JavaScript remote workspace in seconds.  
This example uses **React + TypeScript + Vite** but you can adapt it to any Node-based stack.

## 1 · Complete `devcontainer.json`

Save the file below to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` in your repository **or** upload it while creating the workspace.

```jsonc
{
  // ➊ Friendly name shown in the workspace list
  "name": "React Remote Workspace",

  // ➋ Official image with Node 20 + common tooling
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20-bullseye",

  // ➌ Install project dependencies right after the container is created
  "postCreateCommand": "corepack enable && pnpm install",

  // ➍ Forward ports so Factory auto-detects and previews them
  "forwardPorts": [5173],

  // ➎ Workspace-local VS Code settings (applied inside the remote workspace)
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.scrollback": 10000,
    "eslint.format.enable": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },

  // ➏ Recommended VS Code extensions for everyone who enters the workspace
  "extensions": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "steoates.autoimport"
  ],

  // ➐ Lifecycle hooks – run tests after dependencies are installed
  "postAttachCommand": "pnpm test --if-present"
}
```

### What each setting does

| Marker | Field | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ➊ `name` | Display name in Factory UI. |
| ➋ `image` | Starts from a Node 20 image that already includes `git`, `curl`, and common JS tooling. |
| ➌ `postCreateCommand` | Runs **once** after the container is built; installs packages via **pnpm** (fastest). Replace with `npm install` if preferred. |
| ➍ `forwardPorts` | Exposes Vite’s default dev server on port **5173** so Factory shows a live preview link. |
| ➎ `settings` | VS Code-style settings scoped *inside* the remote workspace—keeps local editor prefs untouched. |
| ➏ `extensions` | Auto-installs linting/formatting helpers for every collaborator—no manual setup. |
| ➐ `postAttachCommand` | Runs **every time** someone connects; perfect for lightweight checks like unit tests. |

---

## 2 · Common Commands

Once the workspace is attached to your session, open the **Terminal** toolkit and try:

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Start dev server | `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`) |
| Run unit tests | `pnpm test` |
| Execute linter | `pnpm lint` |
| Build production bundle | `pnpm build` |
| Install a package | `pnpm add axios` |
| Upgrade deps | `pnpm up --latest` |
| Check TypeScript types | `pnpm type-check` |

All output streams back into chat; no local Node install required.

## 3 · JavaScript / TypeScript Best Practices in Remote Workspaces

1. **Use pnpm + corepack** – Faster installs and deterministic lockfiles (`corepack enable && pnpm install`).  
2. **Cache build tools** – Move heavy installs (Playwright, Cypress) to a Dockerfile stage to speed up rebuilds.  
3. **Lock Node version** – Pin to a major/minor (`20-bullseye`) so everyone runs the same runtime.  
4. **Keep `forwardPorts` in sync** – If you switch to Next.js (port 3000) or Remix (port 5173), update the list.  
5. **Run type checks on attach** – Catch errors early with `postAttachCommand: "pnpm type-check"`.  
6. **Share VS Code extensions** – List ESLint/Prettier so new teammates are productive from minute one.  
7. **Avoid global installs** – Use workspace scripts; they’re already on the PATH inside the remote workspace.  
8. **Test locally** – `devcontainer up` before committing to ensure the image builds without Factory-specific magic.

### Next steps

- **Customize** the image by adding a `Dockerfile` for Playwright, Prisma, etc.  
- **Add Secrets** (e.g., `API_KEY`) in **Integrations → Secrets** and reference them in your devcontainer.  
- **Rebuild** the workspace after any devcontainer change to pick up new tooling.
