title: Best Practices for Remote Workspaces
description: Proven tips and workflows to get the most out of remote workspaces in Factory
---

Remote workspaces let you spin up consistent, production-ready development environments in seconds. Below are field-tested practices that keep workspaces fast, predictable, and team-friendly.

## 1. Optimize Your Devcontainer

| Practice                       | Why it matters                                        | How to do it                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start from the right image** | Lean images build faster and consume fewer resources. | Choose the _closest_ official image (e.g., `javascript-node:20`) and layer tools on top.              |
| **Cache heavy tooling**        | Re-downloading large packages slows rebuilds.         | Move expensive installs (e.g., Chrome, large SDKs) to the image stage instead of `postCreateCommand`. |
| **Shrink build context**       | Huge contexts = slow uploads.                         | Add `**/node_modules`, build artifacts, and secrets to `.dockerignore`.                               |
| **Forward only needed ports**  | Too many ports clutter the UI.                        | Keep `forwardPorts` to the handful you actually use.                                                  |

> **Tip:** Test locally with the Dev Containers CLI (`devcontainer up`) before committing.

## 2. Git Workflows Inside a Remote Workspace

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Branch Fast" icon="git-branch">
    Create feature branches as you would locally:
    `git checkout -b feature/workspace-improvements`.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Commit Often" icon="git-commit">
    Short commit cycles reduce merge pain and keep your workspace snapshot small.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Push via HTTPS" icon="cloud-upload">
    Remote credentials are injected automatically—no need to copy SSH keys.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Rebase for Clean History" icon="layers">
    `git pull --rebase origin main` keeps your branch up-to-date without noisy merge commits.
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Remember: everything you do in a remote workspace happens **inside the cloud environment**. Your local machine stays untouched until you pull changes down.

## 3. Workflow Patterns That Scale

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Spin-Up-Per-Task">
    Treat remote workspaces as disposable: create one per ticket or PR, then archive when merged.  
    **Benefits:** perfect isolation, zero “works on my machine” drift.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared Review Environments">
    For larger features, keep a named workspace (e.g., “design-review”) that teammates can attach to for demos or QA.  
    **How:** Grant workspace visibility to your team and share the session URL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parallel Environments">
    Need to test multiple branches? Launch two workspaces and attach them to separate sessions; switch context without killing processes.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Team Collaboration Tips

| Tip                         | Details                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name workspaces clearly** | Use `service-purpose-branch` (e.g., `api-auth-refactor`) so teammates know what’s running.                  |
| **Document entry commands** | Add a `README_REMOTE_WORKSPACE.md` with common tasks (`npm run dev`, `pytest`)—new hires onboard instantly. |

## 5. Troubleshooting at a Glance

| Symptom                      | Resolution                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rebuild is slow**          | Verify `.dockerignore`, cache heavy installs in image, use lighter base.     |
| **Git asks for credentials** | Ensure repository integration is enabled in **Integrations → Repositories**. |
| **Out-of-disk errors**       | Prune package caches (`npm cache clean --force`) or rebuild workspace.       |

### Quick Checklist Before Merging Code

- [ ] All tests pass inside remote workspace
- [ ] Linter is green
- [ ] Devcontainer changes committed
- [ ] Workspace hibernated or archived

Following these practices keeps your remote workspaces fast, secure, and collaborative—so you can focus on shipping code, not configuring machines.
