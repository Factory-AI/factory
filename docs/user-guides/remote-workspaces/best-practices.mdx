Remote workspaces let you spin up consistent, production-ready development environments in seconds. Below are field-tested practices that keep workspaces fast, predictable, and team-friendly.

## 1. Smart Setup Script Practices

| Practice                           | Why it matters                                        | How to do it                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order commands by dependency**   | Later commands may depend on earlier installs.        | Run package installation first: `npm ci && npm run build` or `pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest -q` |
| **Use exact package managers**     | Consistent lockfiles prevent version drift.           | Use `npm ci` (not `npm install`), `pnpm -w i`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt` for reproducible builds |
| **Add error handling**             | Stops build on first failure, saves debugging time.   | Start your script with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail` for proper error handling |
| **Make scripts executable early**  | Avoid permission errors mid-build.                    | Add `chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh && bash ./scripts/setup.sh` or use `bash ./scripts/setup.sh` directly |
| **Keep scripts idempotent**        | Re-running setup shouldn't break things.              | Use flags like `pip install --no-deps` or check for existing files before creating them |
| **Minimize heavy operations**      | Long builds slow down workspace creation.             | Focus on essential setup; defer optional tools to manual installation later |

> **Tip:** Test your setup script locally first. The script runs with `bash` at the repo root, and you can add `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling.

## 2. Workflow Patterns That Scale

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Spin-Up-Per-Task">
    Treat remote sessions as disposable: create one per ticket or PR, then archive when merged.  
    **Benefits:** perfect isolation, zero “works on my machine” drift.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parallel Environments">
    Need to test multiple branches? Launch two separate sessions; switch context without killing processes.

## 3. Team Collaboration Tips

| Tip                         | Details                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name workspaces clearly** | Name workspaces according to the tracked repository, e.g. `factory-mono` to work on the `factory-mono` GitHub repo. |
| **Document entry commands** | Add an `AGENTS.md` file with common tasks (`npm run dev`, `pytest`). Droid automatically reads this file.           |

## 5. Troubleshooting at a Glance

| Symptom                      | Resolution                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rebuild is slow**          | Verify `.dockerignore`, cache heavy installs in image, use lighter base.     |
| **Git asks for credentials** | Ensure repository integration is enabled in **Integrations → Repositories**. |
| **Out-of-disk errors**       | Prune package caches (`npm cache clean --force`) or rebuild workspace.       |

Following these practices keeps your remote workspaces fast, secure, and collaborative—so you can focus on shipping code, not configuring machines.
