title: Remote Workspaces – Installation & Usage
description: Set up, connect to, and use Remote Workspaces inside Factory sessions
---

A **remote workspace** is a fully-configured, on-demand development environment that lives in the cloud. Remote workspaces give you the same tools and dependencies you'd expect locally—without any machine-setup friction—so you can build, test, and run code directly from Factory.

## System Requirements

- A repository enabled in Factory
- A valid `devcontainer.json` (see below)
- Manager role or higher to create remote workspaces

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Session Settings">
    1. In Factory, click the **Settings** icon from the left sidebar.  
    2. Select **Session**.
    3. Scroll down to **Remote Workspaces**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Remote Workspace">
    1. Click **Create Workspace**.  
    2. Enter the repository you want to use.  
    3. Give your workspace a friendly name (e.g., “frontend-workspace”).  
    4. (Optional) Upload a custom <code>devcontainer.json</code>.  
    5. (Optional) Enter custom commands to run.
    6. Click **Create**.
    <Note>
      Factory clones your repo and prepares the environment—this can take a minute for large projects.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Workspace Ready">
    The new workspace appears in the list with a status indicator. Once it shows **Ready**, you can use it from any session.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Understanding Devcontainers

A _devcontainer_ defines everything your remote workspace needs—language runtimes, tools, and commands—so every workspace is identical and reproducible.

### Minimal JavaScript Example

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Node.js",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20-bullseye",
  "forwardPorts": [3000],
  "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.scrollback": 10000
  }
}
```

Save this file as `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` in your repo or upload it when creating the workspace.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a devcontainer?">
    Factory can generate a basic environment automatically, but adding your own devcontainer guarantees the exact toolchain your project requires.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Updating devcontainer settings">
    Re-upload a new <code>devcontainer.json</code> from the workspace menu and click **Rebuild**. The remote workspace is rebuilt on the next launch.
  </Accordion>

## Launching a Remote Workspace inside a Session

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open or Start a Session">
    Join any Factory session as usual.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to Cloud Machine">
    1. Click the **CPU** icon in the top-right toolbar.  
    2. Choose **Remote Machine**.  
    3. Select the workspace you created earlier.  
    4. Factory attaches the remote workspace to your session.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Connection">
    A green indicator and machine name appear next to the CPU icon. You’re now interacting with the cloud workspace.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Everyday Usage

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Run CLI Commands" icon="terminal">
    Use the **Terminal** toolkit to execute commands like:
    <pre>npm run dev
pytest
git status</pre>
    Output streams live into chat and logs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Edit & Save Files" icon="file-code">
    Open files from the repo, make changes, and save.  
    Files persist in the remote workspace and can be committed upstream when ready.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Port Forwarding" icon="globe">
    If your devcontainer exposes ports (e.g., 3000), Factory auto-detects and adds them to the **Ports** panel for browser preview.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Auto-Save Controls" icon="save">
    Auto-save is disabled by default—enable it from the **Session Settings** panel whenever you want live file syncing.

## Troubleshooting & Help

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Can't connect from session">
    Ensure you:  
    1. Selected **Remote Machine** (not Local).  
    2. Refresh the page, or try again in a different session
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Command not found">
    Verify the binary is installed in your devcontainer and that <code>postCreateCommand</code> completes without errors.
  </Accordion>
