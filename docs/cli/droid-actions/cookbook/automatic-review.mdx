title: Automatic Reviews
description: Enable automatic code reviews when pull requests are created
---

Automatic code reviews trigger whenever a PR is opened or marked ready for review, providing instant feedback without manual intervention.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up automatic reviews:

1. Install the Factory Droid GitHub App at [github.com/apps/factory-droid](https://github.com/apps/factory-droid)
2. Add `FACTORY_API_KEY` to your repository or organization secrets ([get your key](https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys))

## Installation

Create `.github/workflows/droid-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: Droid Auto Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, ready_for_review, reopened]

concurrency:
  group: droid-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  droid-review:
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@v1
        with:
          factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
          automatic_review: true
```

## How it works

1. PR is opened or marked ready for review
2. Workflow triggers automatically (no `@droid` tag needed)
3. Droid analyzes all changed files
4. Posts inline comments on issues found
5. Leaves a summary comment

## Configuration

**Skip draft PRs:**
```yaml
if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
```

**Concurrency control:**
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: droid-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
Cancels outdated runs when new commits are pushed.

**Timeout:**
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 15
```
Adjust based on typical PR size.

## Best practices

- Use draft PRs during development to avoid review noise
- Include concurrency control to cancel outdated runs
- Set reasonable timeouts based on repo size
- Combine with manual reviews for comprehensive coverage
