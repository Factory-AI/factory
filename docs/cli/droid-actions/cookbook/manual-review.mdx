## What Droid reviews

Droid focuses on:

- **Dead/unreachable code** - Code that will never execute
- **Broken control flow** - Missing breaks, incorrect fallthrough
- **Async/await mistakes** - Missing await, unhandled promises
- **Type errors** - Null/undefined issues, incorrect coercion
- **Security issues** - SQL injection, XSS, resource leaks
- **Logic errors** - Off-by-one errors, race conditions

## What Droid skips

- Code style or formatting
- Naming conventions
- Architectural decisions
- Minor performance optimizations

## Example output

**Inline comment:**
```
This function returns early without awaiting the database transaction, 
which may cause the connection to close before the operation completes.

Fix: Add await before the transaction call
```

**Summary comment:**
```
Found 2 potential issues:
- 1 high priority: Missing await in async function
- 1 medium priority: Possible null reference

Please review the inline comments.
```
