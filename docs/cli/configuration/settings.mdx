## Accessing settings

To configure droid settings:

1. Run `droid`
2. Enter `/settings`
3. Adjust your preferences interactively

Changes take effect immediately and are saved to your settings file.

## Where settings live

| OS        | Location                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| macOS / Linux | `~/.factory/settings.json` |
| Windows   | `%USERPROFILE%\.factory\settings.json` |

If the file doesn't exist, it's created with defaults the first time you run **droid**.

## Available settings

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `model` | Provider IDs such as `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `gpt-5-2025-08-07`, `gpt-5-codex`, `glm-4.6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Default model for new sessions (friendly names shown inside `/settings`). |
| `reasoningEffort` | `off`, `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high` (availability depends on the model) | Model-dependent default | Controls how much structured thinking the model performs. |
| `autonomyLevel` | `normal`, `spec`, `auto-low`, `auto-medium`, `auto-high` | `normal` | Sets the default autonomy mode when starting droid. |
| `cloudSessionSync` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Mirror CLI sessions to Factory web. |
| `diffMode` | `github`, `unified` | `github` | Choose between split GitHub-style diffs and a single-column view. |
| `completionSound` | `off`, `bell`, `fx-ok01`, `fx-ack01`, or an absolute path to a `.wav` file | `off` | Audio cue when a response finishes. |
| `completionSoundFocusMode` | `always`, `focused`, `unfocused` | `always` | Control when completion sounds play relative to terminal focus. |
| `commandAllowlist` | Array of commands | Safe defaults provided | Commands that run without extra confirmation. |
| `commandDenylist` | Array of commands | Restrictive defaults provided | Commands that always require confirmation. |
| `includeCoAuthoredByDroid` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Automatically append the Droid co-author trailer to commits. |
| `enableDroidShield` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enable secret scanning and git guardrails. |
| `specSaveEnabled` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Persist spec outputs to disk. |
| `specSaveDir` | File path | `.factory/docs` | Directory used when `specSaveEnabled` is `true`. |
| `enableCustomDroids` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Toggle the experimental Custom Droids feature. |

### Model

Use the settings menu to pick the default model for new sessions. The UI shows friendly names, while `settings.json` stores the provider IDs listed above:

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) – default balanced model.
- **Claude Opus 4.1** (`claude-opus-4-1-20250805`) – highest capability Anthropic model.
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) – previous-generation Sonnet.
- **OpenAI GPT-5** (`gpt-5-2025-08-07`) – OpenAI flagship model.
- **OpenAI GPT-5 Codex (Auto)** (`gpt-5-codex`) – optimized for IDE-style coding.
- **Droid Core (GLM-4.6)** (`glm-4.6`) – factory-hosted open model.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) – fastest Anthropic tier.

[You can also add custom models and BYOK.](/cli/configuration/byok)

### Reasoning effort

`reasoningEffort` adjusts how much structured thinking the model performs before replying. Available values depend on the model, but typically include:

- **`off` / `none`** – disable structured reasoning (fastest).
- **`low`**, **`medium`**, **`high`** – progressively increase deliberation time for more complex reasoning.

Anthropic models default to `off`, while GPT-5 starts on `medium`.

### Autonomy level

`autonomyLevel` controls how proactively droid executes commands when sessions begin. Start at `normal`, or select an `auto-*` preset to pre-authorize additional actions.

### Diff mode

Control how droid displays code changes:

- **`github`** – Side-by-side, higher fidelity render (recommended).
- **`unified`** – Traditional single-column diff format.

### Cloud session sync

When this switch is on, every CLI session is mirrored to Factory web so you can revisit conversations in the browser:

- **`true`** – Sync sessions to the web app.
- **`false`** – Keep sessions local only.

### Sound notifications

Configure audio feedback when droid completes a response, helping you multitask without staring at the terminal:

**Sound option (`completionSound`):**
- **`fx-ok01`** – Friendly built-in chime.
- **`fx-ack01`** – Tactile notification tone.
- **`bell`** – System terminal bell.
- **Absolute file path** – Point to your own `.wav` file.
- **`off`** – Disable audio alerts.

Place custom sounds somewhere readable by the CLI (for example `~/Sounds/droid-complete.wav`) and store the absolute path in `completionSound`. The TUI keeps existing custom paths in its menu so you can toggle them later.

**Focus mode (`completionSoundFocusMode`):**
- **`always`** – Play sounds regardless of terminal focus.
- **`focused`** – Only play when the terminal window is focused.
- **`unfocused`** – Only play when the terminal is in the background (useful for notifications).

<Note>
  Access sound settings quickly via `/settings` or `Shift+Tab` → **Settings** → **Sound** in the TUI.
</Note>

## Command allowlist & denylist

Use these settings to control which commands droid can execute automatically and which it must never run:

- **`commandAllowlist`** – Commands in this array are treated as safe and run without additional confirmation, regardless of autonomy prompts. Include only low-risk utilities you rely on frequently (for example `ls`, `pwd`, `dir`).
- **`commandDenylist`** – Commands in this array always require confirmation and are typically blocked because they are destructive or unsafe (for example recursive `rm`, `mkfs`, or privileged system operations).

Commands that appear in both lists default to the denylist behavior. Any command that is in neither list falls back to the autonomy level you selected for the session.

### Example allow/deny configuration

```json
{
  "commandAllowlist": [
    "ls",
    "pwd",
    "dir"
  ],
  "commandDenylist": [
    "rm -rf /",
    "mkfs",
    "shutdown"
  ]
}
```

Review and update these arrays periodically to match your workflow and security posture, especially when sharing configurations across teams.

## Example configuration

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "reasoningEffort": "low",
  "diffMode": "github",
  "cloudSessionSync": true,
  "completionSound": "fx-ok01",
  "completionSoundFocusMode": "focused"
}
```
