## Accessing settings

To configure droid settings:

1. Run `droid`
2. Enter `/settings`
3. Adjust your preferences interactively

Changes take effect immediately and are saved to your settings file.

## Where settings live

| OS        | Location                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| macOS / Linux | `~/.factory/settings.json` |
| Windows   | `%USERPROFILE%\.factory\settings.json` |

If the file doesn't exist, it's created with defaults the first time you run **droid**.

## Available settings

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `model` | `sonnet`, `opus`, `GPT-5`, `gpt-5-codex`, `haiku`, `droid-core`, `custom-model` | `sonnet` | The default AI model used by droid |
| `reasoningEffort` | `off`, `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high` (availability depends on the model) | Model-dependent default | Controls how much structured thinking the model performs. |
| `autonomyLevel` | `normal`, `spec`, `auto-low`, `auto-medium`, `auto-high` | `normal` | Sets the default autonomy mode when starting droid. |
| `cloudSessionSync` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Mirror CLI sessions to Factory web. |
| `diffMode` | `github`, `unified` | `github` | Choose between split GitHub-style diffs and a single-column view. |
| `completionSound` | `off`, `bell` | `off` | Audio cue when a response finishes. |
| `commandAllowlist` | Array of commands | Safe defaults provided | Commands that run without extra confirmation. |
| `commandDenylist` | Array of commands | Restrictive defaults provided | Commands that always require confirmation. |
| `includeCoAuthoredByDroid` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Automatically append the Droid co-author trailer to commits. |
| `enableDroidShield` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enable secret scanning and git guardrails. |
| `specSaveEnabled` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Persist spec outputs to disk. |
| `specSaveDir` | File path | `.factory/docs` | Directory used when `specSaveEnabled` is `true`. |
| `enableCustomDroids` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Toggle the experimental Custom Droids feature. |

### Model

Choose the default AI model that powers your droid:

- **`sonnet`** - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (recommended, current default)
- **`opus`** - Claude Opus 4.1 for complex tasks
- **`GPT-5`** - Latest OpenAI model
- **`gpt-5-codex`** - Advanced coding-focused model
- **`haiku`** - Claude Haiku 4.5, fast and cost-effective
- **`droid-core`** - GLM-4.6 open-source model
- **`custom-model`** - Your own configured model via BYOK

[You can also add custom models and BYOK.](/cli/configuration/byok)

### Reasoning effort

`reasoningEffort` adjusts how much structured thinking the model performs before replying. Available values depend on the model, but typically include:

- **`off` / `none`** – disable structured reasoning (fastest).
- **`low`**, **`medium`**, **`high`** – progressively increase deliberation time for more complex reasoning.

Anthropic models default to `off`, while GPT-5 starts on `medium`.

### Autonomy level

`autonomyLevel` controls how proactively droid executes commands when sessions begin. Start at `normal`, or select an `auto-*` preset to pre-authorize additional actions.

### Diff mode

Control how droid displays code changes:

- **`github`** – Side-by-side, higher fidelity render (recommended).
- **`unified`** – Traditional single-column diff format.

### Cloud session sync

When this switch is on, every CLI session is mirrored to Factory web so you can revisit conversations in the browser:

- **`true`** – Sync sessions to the web app.
- **`false`** – Keep sessions local only.

### Sound notifications

Configure audio feedback when droid completes a response:

- **`bell`** – Use the system terminal bell
- **`off`** – No sound notifications

<Note>
  Access sound settings via `/settings` or `Shift+Tab` → **Settings** in the TUI.
</Note>

## Command allowlist & denylist

Use these settings to control which commands droid can execute automatically and which it must never run:

- **`commandAllowlist`** – Commands in this array are treated as safe and run without additional confirmation, regardless of autonomy prompts. Include only low-risk utilities you rely on frequently (for example `ls`, `pwd`, `dir`).
- **`commandDenylist`** – Commands in this array always require confirmation and are typically blocked because they are destructive or unsafe (for example recursive `rm`, `mkfs`, or privileged system operations).

Commands that appear in both lists default to the denylist behavior. Any command that is in neither list falls back to the autonomy level you selected for the session.

### Example allow/deny configuration

```json
{
  "commandAllowlist": [
    "ls",
    "pwd",
    "dir"
  ],
  "commandDenylist": [
    "rm -rf /",
    "mkfs",
    "shutdown"
  ]
}
```

Review and update these arrays periodically to match your workflow and security posture, especially when sharing configurations across teams.

## Example configuration

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "reasoningEffort": "low",
  "diffMode": "github",
  "cloudSessionSync": true,
  "completionSound": "bell"
}
```
