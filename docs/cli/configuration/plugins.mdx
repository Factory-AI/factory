Plugins let you extend Droid with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. A plugin bundles skills, slash commands, hooks, agents, and MCP servers into a single, distributable package.

## What are plugins?

Plugins are directories containing a manifest file (`.factory-plugin/plugin.json`) and optional components like skills, commands, hooks, and agents. Unlike standalone configuration in `.factory/`, plugins are designed for sharing and distribution.

**Plugin components:**

| Component | Purpose | Invocation |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Skills** | Reusable capabilities with instructions and tools | Model-invoked automatically based on task |
| **Commands** | Slash commands for specific workflows | User-invoked via `/plugin-name:command` |
| **Hooks** | Event handlers for automation | Triggered by events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.) |
| **Agents** | Specialized subagent definitions | Called via Task tool |
| **MCP Servers** | External tool integrations | Available as tools when plugin is active |

## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

| Approach | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| **Standalone** (`.factory/` directory) | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments |
| **Plugins** | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |

Start with standalone configuration in `.factory/` for quick iteration, then convert to a plugin when you're ready to share.

## Installing plugins

### From a marketplace

Register a marketplace first, then install plugins from it:

```bash
# Add a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add owner/repo

# Install a plugin
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

### From a local directory

Test plugins during development with the `--plugin-dir` flag:

```bash
droid --plugin-dir ./my-plugin
```

### Managing plugins

```bash
# List installed plugins
/plugin

# Disable a plugin
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name

# Re-enable a plugin
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name

# Uninstall a plugin
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

## Plugin structure

Every plugin follows this directory structure:

```
my-plugin/
├── .factory-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest (required)
├── commands/                 # Slash commands (optional)
│   └── my-command.md
├── skills/                   # Agent skills (optional)
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── agents/                   # Subagent definitions (optional)
│   └── my-agent.md
├── hooks/                    # Event handlers (optional)
│   └── hooks.json
├── .mcp.json                 # MCP server configs (optional)
└── README.md                 # Documentation
```

<Warning>
Don't put `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, or `hooks/` inside the `.factory-plugin/` directory. Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.factory-plugin/`. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.
</Warning>

### Plugin manifest

The manifest at `.factory-plugin/plugin.json` defines your plugin's identity:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "A helpful description of what this plugin does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  }
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Unique identifier and skill namespace. Commands are prefixed with this (e.g., `/my-plugin:command`). |
| `description` | Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing. |
| `version` | Track releases using semantic versioning. |
| `author` | Optional. Helpful for attribution. |

## Plugin scopes

When installing plugins, you choose an installation scope:

| Scope | Location | Visibility |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **User** | `~/.factory/plugins/` | Available across all your projects |
| **Project** | `.factory/settings.json` | Shared with teammates via git |
| **Local** | Local config only | Your machine, this project only |

## Marketplaces

Marketplaces are catalogs of plugins that you can browse and install from.

### Adding marketplaces

```bash
# From GitHub
/plugin marketplace add owner/repo

# From other Git hosts
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git

# From local path
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

### Managing marketplaces

```bash
# List all marketplaces
/plugin marketplace list

# Update marketplace listings
/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name

# Remove a marketplace
/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name
```

### Team marketplaces

Configure automatic marketplace installation for your team by adding to `.factory/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": [
    "your-org/internal-plugins"
  ],
  "enabledPlugins": [
    "code-standards@your-org-internal-plugins"
  ]
}
```

## Discovering plugins

### Official Factory plugins

Factory maintains an official plugin marketplace at `Factory-AI/factory-plugins` with curated plugins:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Factory-AI/factory-plugins
```

**Available plugins:**

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **droid-evolved** | Skills for continuous learning: session navigation, human writing, skill creation, visual design, frontend design, browser automation |
| **security-engineer** | Security review, threat modeling, commit scanning, and vulnerability validation |

Install with:

```bash
/plugin install droid-evolved@factory-plugins
/plugin install security-engineer@factory-plugins
```

### Community plugins

| Plugin | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **superpowers** | Complete software development workflow with brainstorming, planning, and subagent-driven development | `obra/superpowers` |

### Enterprise Plugin Registry

For organizations that need centralized control over approved plugins, see [Enterprise Plugin Registry](/enterprise/enterprise-plugin-registry). This allows you to:

- Maintain a private marketplace of approved plugins
- Pre-install mandatory plugins for all users
- Organize plugins by team, role, or capability

### Claude Code compatibility

Droid is compatible with plugins built for Claude Code. If you find a Claude Code plugin you'd like to use, you can install it directly - the plugin format is interoperable. See the [Claude Code plugins documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) for more details.
