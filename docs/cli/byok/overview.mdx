description: Connect your own API keys, use open source models, or run local models
---

Factory CLI supports custom model configurations through BYOK (Bring Your Own Key). Use your own OpenAI or Anthropic keys, connect to any open source model providers, or run models locally on your hardware. Once configured, switch between models using the `/model` command.

<Note>
  Your API keys remain local and are not uploaded to Factory servers. Custom models are only available in the CLI and won't appear in Factory's web or mobile platforms.

## Configuration Reference

Add custom models in `~/.factory/config.json` under the `custom_models` array.

### Supported Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `model_display_name` | ✓ | Human-friendly name shown in model selector |
| `model` | ✓ | Model identifier sent via API (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `gpt-5-codex`, `qwen3:4b`) |
| `base_url` | ✓ | API endpoint base URL |
| `api_key` | ✓ | Your API key for the provider. Can't be empty. |
| `provider` | ✓ | One of: `anthropic`, `openai`, or `generic-chat-completion-api` |
| `max_tokens` | ✓ | Maximum output tokens for model responses |

## Understanding Providers

Factory supports three provider types that determine API compatibility:

| Provider | API Format | Use For | Documentation |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages API (v1/messages) | Anthropic models on their official API or compatible proxies | [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) |
| `openai` | OpenAI Responses API | OpenAI models on their official API or compatible proxies. Required for the newest models like GPT-5 and GPT-5-Codex. | [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) |
| `generic-chat-completion-api` | OpenAI Chat Completions API | OpenRouter, Fireworks, Together AI, Ollama, vLLM, and most open-source providers | [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) |

<Warning>
  Factory is actively verifying Droid's performance on popular models, but we cannot guarantee that all custom models will work out of the box. Only Anthropic and OpenAI models accessed via their official APIs are fully tested and benchmarked.
</Warning>

## Prompt Caching

Factory CLI automatically uses prompt caching when available to reduce API costs:

- **Official providers (`anthropic`, `openai`)**: Factory attempts to use prompt caching via the official APIs. Caching behavior follows each provider's implementation and requirements.
- **Generic providers (`generic-chat-completion-api`)**: Prompt caching support varies by provider and cannot be guaranteed. Some providers may support caching, while others may not.

### Verifying Prompt Caching

To check if prompt caching is working correctly with your custom model:

1. Run a conversation with your custom model
2. Use the `/cost` command in Droid CLI to view cost breakdowns
3. Look for cache hit rates and savings in the output

If you're not seeing expected caching savings, consult your provider's documentation about their prompt caching support and requirements.

## Quick Start

Choose a provider from the left navigation to see specific configuration examples:

- **[OpenAI & Anthropic](/cli/byok/openai-anthropic)** - Use your own API keys for official models
- **[OpenRouter](/cli/byok/openrouter)** - Access multiple providers through a single interface
- **[Fireworks AI](/cli/byok/fireworks)** - High-performance inference for open-source models
- **[Baseten](/cli/byok/baseten)** - Deploy and serve custom models
- **[DeepInfra](/cli/byok/deepinfra)** - Cost-effective inference for open-source models
- **[Hugging Face](/cli/byok/huggingface)** - Connect to models on HF Inference API
- **[Ollama](/cli/byok/ollama)** - Run models locally or in the cloud
- **[Google Gemini](/cli/byok/google-gemini)** - Access Google's Gemini models

---

## Using Custom Models

Once configured, access your custom models in the CLI:

1. Use the `/model` command
2. Your custom models appear in a separate "Custom models" section below Factory-provided models
3. Select any model to start using it

Custom models display with the name you set in `model_display_name`, making it easy to identify different providers and configurations.

## Troubleshooting

### Model not appearing in selector
- Check JSON syntax in `~/.factory/config.json`
- Restart the CLI after making configuration changes
- Verify all required fields are present

### "Invalid provider" error
- Provider must be exactly `anthropic`, `openai`, or `generic-chat-completion-api`
- Check for typos and ensure proper capitalization

### Authentication errors
- Verify your API key is valid and has available credits
- Check that the API key has proper permissions
- Confirm the base URL matches your provider's documentation

### Local model won't connect
- Ensure your local server is running (e.g., `ollama serve`)
- Verify the base URL is correct and includes `/v1/` suffix if required
- Check that the model is pulled/available locally

### Rate limiting or quota errors
- Check your provider's rate limits and usage quotas
- Consider adding multiple API keys for load balancing
- Monitor your usage through your provider's dashboard

## Billing

- You pay your provider directly with no Factory markup or usage fees
- Track costs and usage in your provider's dashboard
