## PagerDuty + Factory Integration Benefits

- **Bring PagerDuty context into Factory's AI workflow.** Paste or mention any PagerDuty incident URL in chat and Factory automatically pulls in the full incident timeline, alerts, responders and notes.
- **Accelerate incident triage.** Engineers see enriched incident details side-by-side with code, logs and other context, reducing tool-switching needs.
- **Generate fixes faster.** Factory can analyze the imported PagerDuty data, identify likely root causes and propose remediation PRs.
- **Zero-maintenance integration.** OAuth-based—no service keys, Event Rules or manual configuration inside PagerDuty.

## How it Works

- A Factory user connects their PagerDuty account using OAuth with read-only scope.
- When a PagerDuty incident URL is pasted into Factory chat, Factory retrieves the incident's details, alerts and notes to help root cause the problem.
- Factory displays this parsed information in the Context Panel and incorporates it in its responses and suggestions.

## Requirements

- A PagerDuty user who can authorize OAuth applications.
- A Factory account with permission to manage personal integrations.

## Support

## Integration Walkthrough

### In PagerDuty

No configuration is required in PagerDuty. This integration uses OAuth authentication with read-only scope, so there's no need to create services, integrations, or event rules in your PagerDuty account. All setup is completed within Factory.

### In Factory

1. Sign in to Factory and open **Settings**.
2. Locate **PagerDuty** and click **Connect**.
3. A popup redirects to PagerDuty's OAuth screen. Select the account you wish to authorize and click **Allow Access**.
4. When the popup closes, PagerDuty will display as **Connected** with a green dot. You're done—no further steps in PagerDuty are necessary.

#### Verifying the Integration

1. Copy a PagerDuty incident URL, e.g. `https://acme.pagerduty.com/incidents/PRD1234`.
2. Paste it into any Factory chat.
3. The incident details should appear in the Context Panel within a few seconds.

## How to Uninstall

1. In PagerDuty, navigate to **User Settings → Authorized Applications**.
2. Locate **Factory** and click **Revoke Access**.

This immediately invalidates the OAuth token; Factory will stop retrieving data.
