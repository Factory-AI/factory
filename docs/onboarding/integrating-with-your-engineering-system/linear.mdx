## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test issue in one of the authorized Linear projects.
2. Use Factory to interact with this issue (e.g., comment on it or change its status).
3. Verify that the changes are reflected in Linear.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
- Use Linear's team-level settings to manage access efficiently.
- Keep your Linear workspace's security settings up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have the necessary admin rights on both Factory and Linear.
- Check Linear's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
- Verify that the integration has access to the intended teams and projects.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
