This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with Jira, enabling the Factory platform to interact with your Jira boards and issues.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Jira workspace
- A Factory account with admin privileges

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Jira Service Account">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create New User">
        1. In your Jira workspace, create a new user.
        2. Name the user "Factory Droid".
        3. Narrow the scopes to only the projects you want Factory to access.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set Permissions">
        Configure the service account's permissions to limit access to only the necessary Jira boards and projects.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Jira Integration in Factory">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access Integrations">
        Log in to your Factory account and navigate to Integrations in your Settings.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect Jira">
        Click on "Connect Jira" to start the integration process.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Factory's Jira Application">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Switch to Service Account">
        Before authorizing, switch to an incognito browser window and log in with the "Factory Droid" service account you created.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Application">
        Review the requested permissions and click "Authorize" to allow Factory access to your Jira workspace.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After authorization, you'll be redirected back to the Factory platform. Verify that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Session">
    Create a New Session directly from Jira with this ticket in context by clicking the "ðŸ”— Factory - Open in Factory" link

    - Note that clicking this link will always create a **new session**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test issue in one of the authorized Jira projects.
2. Use Factory to interact with this issue (e.g., comment on it or change its status).
3. Verify that the changes are reflected in Jira.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the Factory Droid service account.
- Use Jira's project-level settings to manage access efficiently.
- Periodically rotate the API token if you're using the token-based setup method.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you're logged in as the service account when authorizing the integration.
- Check Jira's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
- Verify that the service account has the necessary permissions for the intended projects.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
