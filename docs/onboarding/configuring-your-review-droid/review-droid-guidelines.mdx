Review Droid Guidelines are targeted instructions that Review Droid follows when reviewing your code. These guidelines ensure that Droid-provided code review comments are desirable, consistent, and specific to your codebase. They are particularly useful for maintaining code quality and enforcing best practices across a project.

## Configuring Guidelines

Guidelines are configured in your `.droid.yaml` file under the `guidelines` field within the `review` section. This configuration allows you to define different instructions based on file paths, ensuring that the guidelines are contextually relevant.

### Basic Structure

Here's an example of how guidelines are structured in the `.droid.yaml` file:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
review:
  guidelines:
    - path: "src/*.py"
      guideline: "Do not use multi-line nested list comprehensions."
    - path: "src/*"
      guideline: "Do not leave in commented out code. Delete it."
    - path: "*"
      guideline: "Correct grammar and spelling mistakes. Do not comment on writing style. Allow for flexible capitalization and abbreviation for variable names."
    - path: "*.ts"
      guideline: "Follow our TypeScript style guide."
      context_document_path: "docs/CONTRIBUTING.md"
    - path: "*"
      guideline: "Follow all of our engineering best practices."
      context_document_path: "https://factory-ai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/factory/pages/9338882/Best+Practices"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Components of a Guideline

- `path`: An fnmatch pattern specifying which file paths this guideline applies to.
- `guideline`: The specific issue you want Droid to comment on, preferably including a suggestion for how to fix it.
- `context_document_path` (optional): Specifies a document that provides additional context to Review Droid when enforcing the guideline. This can be either:
  - A path to a document from the repository root
  - A URL to a Confluence page

## Best Practices for Writing Guidelines

To make the most of Review Droid Guidelines, follow these best practices:

1. **Be Specific and Actionable**: Ensure your guidelines are clear and lead to actionable changes. Vague guidelines can result in inconsistent reviews and misunderstandings.
2. **Complement Existing Tools**: Guidelines should complement other tools like linters and type checkers, not replace them. Use guidelines for aspects that are not easily automated, such as code structure and logic.
3. **Maintain Contextual Relevance**: Tailor your guidelines to the specific context of the code. Different parts of the codebase may require different focus areas during review.
4. **Use Examples**: When possible, provide examples of both good and bad practices in your guidelines to make them more clear and effective.
5. **Keep Guidelines Up-to-Date**: Regularly review and update your guidelines as your project evolves and coding standards change.

## Guideline Examples

Here are some examples of effective guidelines for different aspects of code review:

### Bugs & Errors

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
- path: "src/*"
  guideline: "Catch obvious bugs"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Readability

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
- path: "src/*.py"
  guideline: "Don't use multi-line nested list comprehensions. Break them down into multiple statements for better readability."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Error Handling

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
- path: "src/*.py"
  guideline: "Ensure all file operations are wrapped in try/except blocks to handle I/O errors gracefully."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Security

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
- path: "src/*.py"
  guideline: "Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Use parameterized queries and escape HTML output."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Documentation

<CodeGroup>

```yaml
- path: "src/*.py"
  guideline: "Ensure all public functions have docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, and return values."
```

</CodeGroup>

## Feedback Mechanism

Review Droid incorporates a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the effectiveness of the guidelines. During the review process, reviewers can provide feedback on each guideline using thumbs up or thumbs down reactions.

- **Thumbs Up**: Indicates that the guideline was helpful and should continue to be used in future reviews.
- **Thumbs Down**: Indicates that the guideline was not helpful or needs improvement.

This feedback loop ensures that the guidelines evolve over time based on real-world usage and reviewer experiences, leading to more accurate and valuable review comments.

## Conclusion

By setting up effective Review Droid Guidelines, you can significantly enhance the quality and consistency of your code reviews. Remember to start with a few key guidelines and gradually expand as you learn what works best for your team and project.
