A 5-part series on the new way to use agents for data science and engineering.

<Info>
On the web version of this guide, you can select your specific tools (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) to see tailored examples. The patterns are the same across platforms; only the syntax differs.

## The Core Insight

The biggest unlock for agent-based data work is the access layer. When you give an agent the ability to query your data warehouse, the barrier between "I wonder if..." and "here's the answer" collapses.

But getting there requires upfront investment:

1. **Tool access** to execute queries
2. **Schema knowledge** to know what's available  
3. **Domain knowledge** to avoid common mistakes

This guide walks through practical patterns you can adapt for whatever stack you're running: BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, ClickHouse, DuckDB, Postgres, or any SQL-compatible warehouse.

## Supported Platforms

| Category | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud Warehouses** | BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift |
| **Open Source** | ClickHouse, DuckDB, Postgres, Trino, MySQL |
| **Transformation** | dbt, SQLMesh, Dataform |
| **Observability** | Datadog, Axiom, Honeycomb, OpenTelemetry |

## Quick Start

If you want to get started immediately:

1. Ensure your agent can access your warehouse CLI (see [Part 1](/guides/data/foundation))
2. Create a quick-reference table mapping common questions to tables
3. Document your top 5 data pitfalls in your AGENTS.md
4. Start asking questions

The rest of this guide provides depth on each step, with examples and patterns you can adapt.
